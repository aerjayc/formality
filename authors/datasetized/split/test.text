but the pathos , the lesson , the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy .
2 , nipped the money , too , i reckon .
three minutes later the old man and his sons .
`` i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? ''
they waited a time that seemed an age , and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush .
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling .
he will be in no hurry to leave it again .
could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing .

`` to-night .
take off your jacket . ''

and befriend 'em what i could , and now they've all forgot old muff when he 's in trouble .
my dearest jane .
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .
and she turned away with alarm .
but this only gratified them , since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization .
`` keep still !
and she made the most of the time .
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
, and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .
it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ''
she was very equal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball .
mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley .
huckleberry came and went , at his own free will .
she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )
of his own happiness , and of jane 's perfections .
but now he did not know the necessary symptoms .
but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate .
we 'll leg it together ! ''
accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up .
`` an excellent consolation in its way , '' said elizabeth , `` but it will not do for us .
but angry people are not always wise .
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
tom , i do n't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that .
and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .
which i am certain he has very much at heart . ''
`` and if i had not a letter to write myself .
then mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years .
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her .
just as affable to the poor . ''
and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time .
`` can ! ''
her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home .
but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother .
he had lost every point .
but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings .
they were attracted by this idea .
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm .
where , where is my uncle ? ''
no !
please let me . ''
on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing .
and nothing therefore remained to be done .
do not let them wait for that .
nothing had ever suggested it before .
here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
thinking he recognized these pictures .

`` the advantages of culture '' .
it consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn .

`` why .
and walked boldly on board the boat .
and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.. elizabeth 's courage did not fail her .
only mischeevous .
the old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion .
curious that she should cry .
let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene .
the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
when they were gone .
for the president .
if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .
my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . ''
note : .
but she is too much like her brother , .
huckleberry was filled with admiration of tom 's facility in writing , and the sublimity of his language .
of her dislike of mr. darcy .
the moral will be perfectly fair .
and his heart would soon wear itself out , the way it was beating .
he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on .
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood .
and sorry for her father 's speech .
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : `` my dearest lizzy .
at length .
she should have known nothing about .
they built a fire against the side of a great log
the artist erected a man in the front yard , that resembled a derrick .
mr. gardiner was a sensible .
having never even fancied herself in love before .
it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself .
she comes to us to-day .
an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together .
where shall you change horses ? .
but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world .
he had bushy white whiskers .
and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .
* * * * * in the evening .
but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue .
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .
worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
whose face had the `` interesting '' paleness that comes of pills and indigestion .
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper .
tom moaned out : `` oh , do n't , sid .
than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.. i will only say farther .
`` give it up , and i just leaving this country forever !
so they were going to remove the treasure .
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side .
'' cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , `` i should not care how proud i was .
after the meal they felt rusty , and stiff-jointed , and a little homesick once more .
offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .
he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done .
the alley door closed softly .
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that
mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment .
after they should have begun their adventures .
and .
heaving sturdily at its ball .
`` that you have ordered a good dinner to-day .
mary and kitty , thank heaven !
'' added jane , `` that he comes back no more this winter . ''
however .
these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house .
washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary .
and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth .
and the chosen partner of her fate .
i could n't sleep .
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .
and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine 's drawing-room .
they tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company , visiting the familiar wonders of the cave .
to whose apartment they all repaired .
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .
they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things .
on the contrary .
and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .
what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
nothing of the past was recollected with pain .
here .
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .
but by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .
but for loving her still well enough .
`` no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .
and sid would have come and done it , too .
`` my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them .
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .
a most welcome negative followed the last question .
and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room .
though only a few weeks before .
`` i can not believe it .
the master frowned , and this completed the disaster .
that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground .
`` i wo n't !
but i reckon it 's taking chances . ''
`` yes , sir , i know i am .
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas .
neither boy spoke .
and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees .
and as she did not answer them all herself .
and so on , and so on , hour after hour .
i assure you , '' said he , `` to be dissatisfied with my reception .
is very difficult .
his black flag unfurled .
`` i will not be interrupted .
track the money ! ''
`` aye-aye , sir ! ''
let me never see either one or the other again ! ''
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley .
of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .
darkness everywhere , now .
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair .
i do insist upon it .
`` that is capital , '' added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .
but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run .
at the door tom dropped back a step and accosted a sunday-dressed comrade : `` say .
and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way .
`` i did not think you would.. and that being the case .
the call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the
a body 's got to do things when he 's awful hungry
and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
but why did not you tell me so before ?
and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before .
mr. collins 's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations .
`` and pray may i ask ? ''
mr. collins , '' she added , `` that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
`` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
in return .
i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments .
he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
in the imprudence of anger .
one i will not mention .
`` yes , every one that 's friends to me .
`` they 've stopped ... . no .
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
`` try harder , tom !
and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . ''
tom , what is the matter ? ''
wickham only shook his head .
as he had likewise foretold .
`` for i have always seen a great similarity in the

and unconsciously closed his book .
she talked on , therefore .
she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes .
situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .
who had been brought up by him at his own expence.. `` he is now gone into the army .
mr. collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .
and he was obliged to walk about the room .
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f. but no one can throw any blame on them .
the particulars , i reserve till we meet .
`` all right .
she was dying to know what could be his meaning '' .
yet , notwithstanding injun joe 's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court .
she is quite a little creature .
and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .
and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .
georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
who were to take part in the exercises of the evening .
'' added mrs. gardiner , `` that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
a sigh or two escaped , unawares .
at breakfast .
miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
no one had heart for anything .
'' said darcy , '' of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .
as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for .
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .
`` well .
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them .
maybe it 's the number of a house ! ''
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew .
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .
that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
she said , `` i did not know before that you ever walked this way . ''
but that's human nature .
had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . ''
i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it .
nor will i be dissuaded from it .
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening .
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .
yes .
and she consented .
`` oh !
once or twice she could discern a faint blush .
for he was a quiet boy , and had no adventurous , trouble-some ways .
that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
`` oh , lord !
'' replied she .
they were about to spring for the closet .
without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins .
there can at least be no want of subject.. we may compare our different opinions . ''
for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast .
`` do not you feel a great inclination .
( who .
and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities .
my dear sir .
i can not understand it .
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .
almost engrossed by her nephews .
could n't get along with his grand secret without huck , you know ! ''
who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form .
mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day .
`` surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .
it ai n't anything .
the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have an important talk .
the temptation was too strong .
followed an ant around , with his nose close to the floor , and quickly wearied of that .
my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
`` i 'd like to see you try it . ''
and then .
she cried .
what 's your name ? ''
he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable .
news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff .
come down when you are slicked up enough . ''
and how to get up .
i could see that .
every body said how well she looked .
sarcastic humour .
they then went away .
and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .
for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure .
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : .
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper .
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought .
to him than a man 's are to a man .
tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside .
cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat , tinted with the purple of distance .
he could not help it .
and pains in my head .
a glass of wine.. shall i get you one ? .
`` i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now .
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london .
therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other .
`` and do you like her ? ''
and said in the gentlest of accents .
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . ''
he said .
all elizabeth 's anger against him had been long done away .
as he had reason to hope .
and taking leave of the housekeeper .
you think you 're some , now , do n't you ?
mr. collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .
moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts .
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue .
nobody told me it was you .
the boys started , glanced at each other , and then each assumed a listening attitude .
my dear , '' continued mrs. bennet , `` i am quite delighted with him .
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .
and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .
and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time .
mr. walters fell to `` showing off .
this must be the grossest falsehood ! `` .
a denial .
to hear .
to be a doctor , but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster .
i should be sorry .
and more too , for i am two years older . ''
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties .
and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . ''
jealousy ran red-hot through tom 's veins .
all straggling foot-passengers disappeared .
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as
`` tom , i did n't think of that .
and oh , what shall i do , what shall i do !
i never heard any harm of her .
it was in a percussion-cap box .
the adventure of the day mightily tormented tom 's dreams that night .
he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye , till he saw that she had discovered him .
he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady
hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them .
now .
that is what makes it amusing .
`` now , auntie , that ai n't any harm , '' pleaded mary .
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk .
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .
and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .
how many sisters she had .
'' cried elizabeth .
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy .
no .
was now on the point of accomplishment .
i advise you by all means to refuse him . ''
but there was no moneybox .
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day .
`` guy of guisborne wants no man 's pass .
should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law .
and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .
then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace , and were gladhearted once more .
the whole family returned to their usual employments .
from which she had been so wholly free at first .
for inheriting their father's estate .
that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .
she could spare them very well.. against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved .
how is she ?
he had only reached middle age , and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle .
and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
her father .
she was surprised to hear tom dissent .
`` that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , .
gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened , and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself .
i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .
elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first .
with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .
she turned her eyes on the daughter .
but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp .
which ? ''
she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
well , they 'd just die to be here .
and jane and elizabeth .
but now every sound ceased suddenly .
frightened almost out of her senses .
i am so grieved for him .
it was a graveyard of the old-fashioned western kind .
not that i mean to find fault with you .
some time or other , and then we'll snatch that box quicker ' n lightning . ''
that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in the house .
but aunt polly .
and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick .
though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
which .
did n't they get him saturday night ? ''
i recollected afterwards .
judge thatcher 's family had come back to town the night before .
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .
and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer , he only endured it .
the first week of their return was soon gone .
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
potter dropped his knife , and exclaimed : `` here , now , do n't you hit my pard ! ''
and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .
and the twilight of tradition , and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion .
say , becky , was you ever engaged ? ''
he presently halted under a great elm .
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew .
a lady's imagination is very rapid .
her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .
but they were consuming with envy , nevertheless .
etc. , and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic .
and so after that detective had got through and gone home .
`` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
it's injun joe . ''
`` are you , indeed ?
that is because you have the right disposition .
`` my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? ''
when tea was over , mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table .
and to see dear wickham too !
but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ''
`` there was just such an informality in the terms of
it was this : `` pretty thin .
tom most of all ( she thought ) .
`` it keeps him in good humour .
tom lay awake and waited , in restless impatience .
with his arms upon the long , low desk before him , and seemed to study his book .
which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins .
and then by sir william .
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning .
but the girl never exhibited herself again .
i took out when the pistols went off , and i did n't stop for three mile .
though when the first tumult of joy was over .
and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction .
mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .
do n't be afraid .
a moving hymn was sung , and the text followed : `` i am the resurrection and the life . ''
`` i thought i 'd got sober .
i could lick you with one hand tied behind me , if i wanted to . ''
now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade .
and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
without any heart in it .
`` just let me study a moment .
it lay far over toward the further shore , abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest .
she dared not pronounce .
huckleberry whispered : `` i wisht i knowed .
both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience .
horsewhipped in front of the jail , like a nigger ! .
`` now .
`` have you ?
mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley .
`` but you forget .
it seemed mortified , and it hurt so i never minded my tooth at all . ''
i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent
because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds .
than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed.. a resolution the more necessary to be made .
and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the
to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request .
the former continued the subject .
till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .
imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .
`` you know nothing of the matter .
and a little bag or two .
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible .
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !
in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . ''
`` you began the evening well , charlotte , '' said mrs. bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas .
let me persuade you to follow my example .
and .
she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more .
we may gain some news of them .
miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table .
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise .
and. ``
and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire .
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door .
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .
she instantly resolved to be false .
`` it ai n't much .
and so i hove a brick through his window .
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe .
i knew how it would be .
but intricate characters are the most amusing .
and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to
he added .
when they do n't fight it 's only a sign that there 's trouble around , you know .
to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history .
and i need not say you will be delighted with her .
elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .
now they 're stuck .
hurry along , hurry along ! ''
we had better go into the avenue . ''
you must n't be so bad .
dates , postoffice addresses , and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed ( in candle-smoke ) .
whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .
it 's a good lie .
he wo n't think of the knife till he 's gone so far he
do you reckon they can be upstairs ? ''
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with
lizzy , '' said her father , `` to send for the horses ? ''
every `` haunted '' house in st. petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected .
`` yes . ''
`` but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood .
we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .
he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams .
and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
gasped huckleberry .
`` come up here .
saying that it was plain the children could never be found .
that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
as i trust they will .
the pretended `` compositions '' quoted in this taken without alteration from a volume entitled `` prose and poetry .
but the poem was very satisfactory , nevertheless .
and all that swearing 's got to be done at midnight .
`` all right .
three fishhooks , and one of that kind of marbles known as a `` sure 'nough crystal . ''
useful sort of person .
i 'll tell you what we 'll do .
it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there .
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .
in great astonishment , `` do n't you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?
they tip-toed out , through the broken weather-boarding , and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word .
i dono .
`` no it ai n't , huck , no it ai n't .
glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain .
the charm of life was gone .
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of
`` i ca n't stand it much longer . ''
that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means
but without much success .
`` oh !
how merry we shall be together when we meet ! ''
you go for her looks .
`` 't is an etiquette i despise , '' said he .
the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads .
it was a precious moment .
you must learn some of my philosophy .
and went off to guard the river bank .
`` well i will . ''
`` all this she must possess .
do n't let him get away ! ''
tom said nothing .
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
she was no sooner in possession of it .
a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk .
the church's high-backed , uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons .
his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought .
`` i do not think we were speaking at all .
`` i honour your circumspection .
the door was quickly unlocked , and he entered .
joe was angry in a moment .
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes .
of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance !
for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .
he kept that book under lock and key .
i hopped in , and shook off the towel , and , great caesar 's ghost ! ''
he was such a comfort to me , although he tormented my old heart out of me , 'most . ''
it is all done . ''
to the rest of the family they paid little attention .
were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue .
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency .
but they 've helped muff potter a power , and they 'd help him more if they could . ''
before she was banished to the north .
if i were not afraid of judging harshly .
that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ''
aunt polly .
`` it is , that !
which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier .
for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time , tossing unrestfully , and turning over .
and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .
she supposed .
for the curiosity excited by his long absence .
`` he likes to have his own way very well , '' replied colonel fitzwilliam .
but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person .
when he had pulled a mile above the village .
i wanted to keep you from grieving .
just as we 'd got guns .
he come along one day .
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns .
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face , but alacrity in his heart .
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
every time he stole a glance at the girls ' side of the room becky 's face troubled him .
his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
hot sand .
door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other .
tom said : `` get away from here ! ''
they pegged away in silence for some time .
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious .
`` he das n't tell !
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .
`` not the slightest .
`` yes , very handsome . ''
almost immediately they had reward .
they could not be untouched by his politeness .
mr. jones left the wagon near the door and followed .
then they separated , cogitating .
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings .
and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
yes .
do you go home to dinner ? ''
and the evening .
a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potter's possession .
and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly
tom !
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness . ''
`` by george , he has got something to tell , or he would n't act so ! ''
and prance into sunday-school .
which on every other subject shall be my constant guide .
presently becky began to suspect .
this took dim shape , presently .
whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight .
mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her .
but it must not , shall not be .
within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together .
it was a great many years ago .
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them . ''
when denny .
the justice of the peace .
unsought .
'' with all sorts of official bustlings and activities .
i 'm all in a shiver . ''
then a shrill jay swept down .
who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment .
who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday .
and who probably never looked at you in his life !
under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent 's mind .
they had often attempted it before .
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him .
i might have rejoiced in them as my own .
good or bad ? ''
ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be .
and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain
but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .
he slackened speed .
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something , they only suffered a new disappointment .
when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn .
a generous .
you 're getting the worst of it . ''
now hang it all , we got to come back in the night .
'tai n't in such a very good place .
`` i wish now i 'd thought , '' said tom , with a repentant tone .
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner .
do n't call anybody . ''
`` i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .
i and the boys hoped you 'd turn up and stop here last night . ''
`` i have found out .
`` miss eliza bennet , '' said miss bingley , `` despises cards .
'' replied elizabeth , `` as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget .
was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered .
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings .
lady catherine hesitated for a moment .
tuesday afternoon came , and waned to the twilight .
boys .
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
`` oh , most anybody .
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment .
`` i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day , '' said joe .
and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .
`` i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out .
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air .
`` did you tear this book ? ''
`` indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
what did you want to come here for ? ''
hurst . ''
as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet 's carriage was to meet them .
`` i do n't care whose tick he is .
which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .
`` i have sent for you on an affair of importance .
and .
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage .
and to hate him forever , into the bargain .
if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
for now they do appear wholly undeserved . ''
presently she stopped , and said to herself : `` it was right here .
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world .
i 'll be whipped , and i never was whipped in school . ''
you are lucky in having such a master . ''
without knowing what she said .
that 's all . ''
tom shuddered .
her reflections were in general satisfactory .
'' replied jane , `` and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room .
and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .
and tom 's fingers would be twitching to begin .
stared in return .
he entered a dense wood .
we 'll wait till the lights are out .
and he fell to sobbing again .
`` it will be no use to us .
mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do .
and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.. that
the boys above were as excited as themselves , and as delighted .
it done him good , too .
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour 's acquaintance .
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter .
a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through
whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . ''
and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother .
these are conditions .
for they shall .
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .
i 'll go back to the widder for a month and
they were soon gone again .
he said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave .
but now .
it was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .
and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .
he had to use napkin , cup , and plate .
mrs. wickham !
relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day .
tom was grateful .
i always had a value for him .
`` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
mr. bennet made no answer .
for he was long used to being falsely accused : `` mr. jones .
if he had been wavering before .
`` are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ''
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .
`` yes 'm .
and i think you will agree with me .
his style was not penitent , but haughty .
finally he strode home reluctantly , with his poor head full of visions .
furniture .
the motive professed .
never mind mentioning your companion 's name .
't is to no strangers left i yield these sighs .
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters .
i am so happy .
she seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy .
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
`` i am sure .
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .
till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune . ''
and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .
the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came
becky grew apprehensive .
by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone .
this ai n't any time for blubbering .
he said to her .
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .
in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .
well , we wo n't talk about that .
his feelings were chiefly expressed .
and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley .
told her that he meant to be in london the very next day .
she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected .
and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !
huck dropped his shovel .
of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
`` i did hear .
giving the orders and executing them : `` stop her .
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed .
through her mother 's hands , lydia 's expences had been very little within that sum .
`` how strange this is !
and making a strong effort for it .
`` good heaven !
and such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows .
they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper .
and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
'' and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun .
for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have squeezed his body under the door .
should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her .
she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .
`` exceedingly well .
but so we all were .
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own .
had they sat in one equally lively .
`` but that was only when i first knew her .
but on this point it will be as well to be silent .
he never knew that sid lay nightly watching .
her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .
in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard , and feeling very melancholy .
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . ''
nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .
is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge .
`` it taught me to hope .
you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there .
confound it !
but make a virtue of it by all means .
`` then i thought you prayed for me .
when this information was given .
he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .
now , becky . ''
and creeping along the roof of the `` ell '' on all fours .
which illustrated their sweet .
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence . ''
and he had good hopes of hearing huck's '' maow .
every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand .
you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this .
a struggle and a gallant defence followed .
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .
but above all .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
`` mrs. collins , you must send a servant with them .
mr. bennet treated the matter differently .
throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .
the judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble , a generous , a magnanimous lie .
`` i should imagine not . ''
capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction .
according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .
so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus .
`` why , it 'll be night , sure .
a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion .
`` i wonder , '' said tom in a whisper .
and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world . ''
so they would .
that i do not want to dance a reel at all .
he generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday .
`` my , but we 're rich , tom ! ''
they went about poking sticks into the sand .
and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .
she soon found .
as soon as they were married .
no . ''
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . ''
but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone .
`` and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ''
with his hopes rising and falling .
that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure .
lay out aloft , there , half a dozen of ye .
what do you think has happened this morning ? .
the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort .
mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history .
`` let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ''
an uncomfortable pause .
or the kingdom could boast .
and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit of the night had gone by .
and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! ''
'' said her mother .
your uncle is as much surprised as i am .
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been over-rated .
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear .
becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as
`` then consound it , we 've fooled away all this work for nothing .
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .
uninstructed by an incantation .
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .
mary got your sunday clothes ready , and everybody 's been fretting about you .
he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness . ''
see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .
`` i am not going to run away , papa , '' said kitty , fretfully .
in the cave .
the boy remained as dismal as a hearse .
each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace .
`` you quite mistook mr. darcy .
sir.. you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady .
and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
my avowed one .
mrs. reynolds .
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
dearest lizzy .
there were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat .
and what sort of young lady is she ?
and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
and he chose part of the sermon on the mount , because he could find no verses that were shorter .
i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .
'' added he .
`` these are home questions .
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .
prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out .
observed .
i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
not with great hope .
that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother .
had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .
though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt .
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done .
as yet .
`` say .
the least agreeable circumstance in the business .
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .
`` yes .
and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them .
and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .
somebody 's got to be glad to see huck . ''
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november .
and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws .
it was settled that she and her children should go to london .
`` well .
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you . ''
it is mr. bingley i am sure .
by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner 's behaviour laid them all under .
how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted .
the boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting .
well , go 'long with you .
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse .
drown it to the treetops .
mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
`` my dear , '' replied her husband , `` i have two small favours to request .
i will only add , god bless you .
that thing was what he wanted to talk about now .
and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .
now , where you going to sleep ? ''
has been my folly.. pleased with the preference of one .
now there was a voice .
white with foam .
if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .
as soon as they had driven from the door .
i 'd no business to drink to-night .
turned to him with an arch smile .
most of the boys could say that , and so that cheapened the distinction too much .
and i could wish .
mr. darcy !
and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage .
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere .
and cut the wart so as to get some blood .
`` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy .
and said .
i tried to keep it back , but no use .
they presently entered .
mrs. bennet 's eyes sparkled with pleasure .
she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley .
`` no you ca n't , either . ''
`` indeed ! ''
endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ''
them and told them their situation and their famished condition .
huck stood sentry and tom felt his way into the alley .
and by that form was the only vacant place on the girls ' side of the school-house .
and when they parted .
never .
perhaps his sister does as well for the present .
it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters .
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation .
'' replied darcy .
for of what use could it apparently be to any one .
could bear no comparison.. but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed .
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth .
i can not think so very ill of wickham .
tom was swimming in bliss .
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time .
in whose character we were most unhappily deceived .
i send no compliments to your mother .
with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .
on finding mrs. bennet .
news came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered .
where the wood ceased .
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield .
which might agree with it .
who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton . ''
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all .
having finally resolved against taking orders .
she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance .
your sisters are engaged .
he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam .
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine .
it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild .
your alliance will be a disgrace .
because that 's the way you do when you 're engaged . ''
`` this is a wretched beginning indeed !
and said if he had told them at first , they would n't have started away .
the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster .
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !
`` oh , shucks , i 'll be just as careful .
ruined the immediate prosperity .
it would not be long .
and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
but when she read .
and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
`` indeed , mama , you are mistaken , '' said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .
and i know he will fight wickham .
mr. collins 's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter .
and curse .
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
had nothing to say that could be worth hearing .
`` a little . ''
`` what did you do it for ? ''
are the others coming out ? ''
upon serious consideration .
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself .
`` i been to the circus three or four times .
she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
as of affection to myself . ''
do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion .
the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham were returned .
if she once entered on the subject .
`` well , all right .
they sneaked along so .
on saturday he came again .
`` your great men often are .
ten blue tickets equalled a red one , and could be exchanged for it .
and she walked well.. but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .
`` in point of composition , '' said mary , `` his letter does not seem defective .
so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass .
my dear charles , what do you mean ? ''
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother .
but he was in a fine rage , nevertheless .
said in a lively tone .
he need n't have repeated it .
to console yourself as much as possible .
because of course there 's got to be a gang .
i did not expect such a compliment . ''
no man of common humanity .
then they sat together .
my dear brother , '' replied mrs. bennet , `` that is exactly what i could most wish for .
the company looked at each other with a perplexed interest .
elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .
and the old lady to call on mrs. harper and vanquish her realism with tom 's marvellous dream .
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose .
and .
but as it is .
`` of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty .
that when he went to town last november .
`` that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .
and he said : `` aunt polly .
`` there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them .
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .
said miss bingley .
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .
he slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet .
and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .
before they were joined by kitty .
and then said : `` i 've got it now !
`` my dear , dear lydia ! ''
seeing that he was losing her .
leave it here as we 've always done , i reckon .
why , they 're a dern sight worse ' n dead people .
there 't is again !
as he went out at the door he said : `` siddy , i 'll lick you for that . ''
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .
and i understand from mrs. gardiner .
with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view . ''
but they were off in a jiffy , those villains , and we after them , down through the woods .
specially with gals , cuz they go back on you anyway , and blab if they get in a huff .
`` but they do n't say anything over it , '' said huck .
do n't you remember ?
and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .
as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room .
in time .
no regular ghosts . ''
and reached for his book , but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it .
she was ill. what if she should die !
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance .
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .
who could not listen to their cousin .
but now .
himself , but could never find the hiding-places afterward .
and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .
he returned , now , and hung about the fence till nightfall , `` showing off , '' as before .
so full of contradictions and varieties .
tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore judge thatcher .
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives .
`` i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , '' said darcy .
it was performed in a proper manner .
the exercises began .
and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .
on particular occasions , and in particular places .
`` let me in .
mr. collins was not a sensible man .
'' said she to charlotte , `` by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ''
then all the young clerks in town in a body .
`` as much as i ever wish to be , '' cried elizabeth warmly , .
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene .
'' said elizabeth .
`` we can try , tom .
will you be very angry with me .
in elizabeth 's mind .
`` no , but old mother hopkins told me . ''
was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself .
poor charlotte ! .
i wish the boys could see us now . ''
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence .
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects .
whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !
mr. walters was very earnest of mien , and very sincere and honest at heart .
i write rather slowly . ''
but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it .
should come to his friend within a few days .
when required to depend on his affection for her .
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which
at length , she spoke again .
`` she looks sickly and cross.. yes , she will do for him very well .
if you .
when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours .

aunt polly raised him by the usual handle .
i have not an instant to lose . ''
his mood always determined his manner .
i do n't say it was n't a fine joke .
and i was convinced of her affection . ''
as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them .
this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and
why , it 's a million times bullier than pirating .
there was really a great air of comfort throughout .
indeed.. and now .
every sister except mary agreed to go with her .
then for texas !
but .

but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .
to take the good of every body 's character and make it still better .
the colour which had been driven from her face .
`` we were born in the same parish .
and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one 's altitude .
to which the separation of two young persons .
and must be in london again within a month .
it is highly improper .
then tom said : `` what 's your name ? ''
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?
ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts .
and then he added : `` now you whisper it to me .
`` well , that 's so .
mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage .
mr. collins .
and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification .
or inclination to marry early.. the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth .
and i do n't know how far away north , or south , or east , or whichever it is .
`` and what did she say ? ''
convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
`` no .
d'you reckon he could see anything ?
now , no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples .
no doubt .
so thought every harassed , hampered , respectable boy in st. petersburg .
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place .
`` tom , why did n't you wake me sooner ?
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request .
`` that ai n't no bad notion , tom ! ''
and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .
did n't you hear it ? ''
and there he would continue .
the children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young

sometimes , 'long with the hogs , but laws bless you , he just lifts things when he snores .
it was drawn at the same time as the other .
finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored `` tights '' very fairly .
and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around .
persuaded elizabeth .
and it is the more to be lamented .
`` and besides , if you will i 'll show you my sore toe . ''
`` i never saw any one so shocked .
he ran and brought the boys ' pick and shovel .
hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall .
as he walked up and down the street .
by this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter .
it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled .
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
`` 't is well .
