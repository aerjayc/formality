to warn laggards and stragglers .
its solace was visiting and news .
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .
they saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above .
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there .
miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
`` if one could but go to brighton ! ''
when your father is dead.. i shall not be able to keep you .
miss bingley 's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy .
for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on .
to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .
i do think we behaved very handsomely .
when it became apparent .
mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
`` why , huck , you 'd have to .
do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here ? ''
vain indeed must be all her attentions .
no , look me in the face '' [ her hands rose in appeal ] .
now , for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits .
after a long and thoughtful silence , injun joe said : `` look here , lad .
`` yes .
`` already arisen ! ''
and many claimed that dismal distinction , and offered evidences , more or less tampered with by the witness .
give a loose to your fancy .
his whisper was hardly audible when he said : `` oh , huck , its a stray dog ! ''
`` we may as well leave them by themselves you know . ''
who continued most perseveringly by her side .
and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .
but for your sakes , we would do any thing .
and he pictured himself brought home from the river .
there was not much to take away .
by the great sachem , no !
after a short interruption , `` that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts .
in order to have the earliest assurance of it .
two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay .
how she would throw herself upon him .
't is from no stranger land i now must part .
you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . ''
and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
therefore .
and they had leisure for a full discussion of it .
collins , you must marry .
her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
matches were hardly known there in that day .
they attacked him in various ways .
and they by the harper family .
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ''
a detective .
to elizabeth 's high diversion .
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .
before her marriage .
and tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead , complaining at being disturbed .
that very night he rolled off ' n a shed wher ' he was a layin drunk .
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her .
`` your tooth , indeed !
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else .
`` my dear madam .
`` and men take care that they should . ''
dropped into the `` dumps .
`` yes , almost every day . ''
except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh 's being too hot or too cold .
before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt .
`` earnest , huck .
that i am frightened out of my wits .
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .
they could not fail to conjecture his design .
elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place .
what are we to do ! ''
and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy
close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news .
fight !
as for their mother .
though mixed with regret .
follow ?
'tai n't fair .
on saturday , shortly after noon , the boys were at the dead tree again .
they then sat down .
he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity .
now the boy stole out .
`` perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , '' said elizabeth .
horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction .
the welshman 's sons departed at once .
well , there is company there , i reckon .
and we 'll light up just as ca 'm , and then just see 'em look ! ''
from what can it proceed ?
and existing to an equal degree in both instances .
why does she not come in ? ''
to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous .
`` what you ask , '' said elizabeth , `` is no sacrifice on my side .
she began to soften .
`` as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and i 'll let him alone .
they were simply called his `` other clothes '' .
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .
came up with him , and eagerly cried out , `` oh , papa , what news ?
and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
elizabeth .
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of .
but when the morning dawned at last , all the word that came was , `` send more candles .
if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed .
mrs. bennet instantly answered , `` oh dear ! .
mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say .
than he had earned before in a year .
for .
it was talked about .
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few
for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible
reflecting on what she had heard .
when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia 's character .
and said : `` but you ai n't too warm now , though . ''
`` why , it 's real bully , tom .
after struggling till both were hot and flushed .
by the time ben was fagged out .
but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application .
and as she walked up and down the room .
and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . ''
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her .
as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy .
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
nobody had entered or left the alley .
which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . ''
he was coming to us .
'' said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
do n't you ever weaken , huck , and i wo n't . ''
to a change so sudden and so important .
`` i think you said she was a widow , sir ?
mr. wickham did not play at whist .
acknowledged the whole to me .
and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase .
the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book , the more his ideas wandered .
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves .
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .
tom 's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession .
and so just as the carriage came to the door .
was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .
'' said wickham .
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . ''
`` i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton . ''
`` yours .
and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared .
is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ''
and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .
or covering a skreen .
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned .
a trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent .
of their appearing in very good health .
comfortable path along the shore under the bluff .
neither could tell .
yes , it was settled .
here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so .
'' said she , `` sensible , good humoured , lively .
she said she would wait , now , where she was , and die .
this ai n't the one , but we 'll come to it right away ! ''
and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself .
who 's going to give it ? ''
`` well , poor chap , you do look as if you 'd had a hard night of it .
'' but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the
`` now you 've asked for it .
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them .
under his wig .
another was a wasteful and opulent gush of `` fine language '' .
`` oh , geeminy , it 's him ! ''
and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .
and so mr. bingley is coming down .
within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs , feeling sore and drowsy .
anyways it do n't if she do n't cry .
exclaimed tom .
they 're coming , sure .
'' said elizabeth .
that could be so called .
the period of expectation was now doubled .
who would have thought of my meeting with .
who are your uncles and aunts ?
'' replied darcy .
she makes me wash , they comb me all to thunder .
the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the
but sid and mary were fond of it .
miss lydia is going to be married .
i 've got some .
unable to resist the impulse of curiosity .
the master opened the volume .
and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building .
`` good heavens ! ''
the visitors were given the highest seat of honor .
`` very well .
maybe. ``
so free from self-consequence .
she had confessed hardly a week ago .
in his efforts , he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy .
and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .
`` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .
made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the
could by no means satisfy mr. collins .
it 's jam .
he answered me with the utmost civility .
in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own .
and suffers a vast deal .
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend .
right away , for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared .
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
they have known her much longer than they have known me .
the widow 's servants kept him clean and neat .
he sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands , meditating .
`` tom , how could you be so noble ! ''
we 'll explore it again .
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me .
`` i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning .
made a mighty stir in the poor little village of st. petersburg .
i would really rather not sit down before those who must
i was sometimes quite provoked .
it was his brass andiron knob !
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain .
as twilight drew on , the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared .
however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . ''
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .
the tale flew from man to man .
`` yes 'm .
`` her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town .
that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you .
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow .
collins ! `` .
`` shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ''
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added .
`` is my father in town ? ''
it was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to becky .
that is all settled . ''
as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist .
they had come for their tools .
it never will be sufficient while the world stands , perhaps .
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued .
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment .
shire , might be able to give more information .
huck and me ai n't crybabies .
and even paid me the compliment of saying .
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
`` pride .
by undervaluing their own .
`` i will not detain you a minute .
that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
and what every body will say that knows him , '' replied the other .
but that is not the case here .
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .
he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug .
wrote a short letter to her aunt .
and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger .
the boys were avenged .
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching .
as she was in her room getting ready for a walk .
but mr. bennet was firm : it soon led to another .
as a `` starter .
`` sid ! ''
and now we are better . ''
of his having ten thousand a year .
he keeps a man-servant , does he ? .
tom 's bosom friend sat next him .
`` hush , hush , child , hush !
he never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a
that is to say , thirty or forty years ago .
`` well , i do , too .
tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded : `` now , becky , it 's all done .
`` that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .
the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
a twig snapped under his foot !
aunt polly said : `` goodmorning , mrs. thatcher .
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side .
after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration .
and all for the sake of mr. collins too ! .
but i know the foundation is unjust .
said lydia stoutly , `` i am not afraid .
`` that 's it !
`` i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , .
and she coloured at the idea .
`` well .
now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing in the brook .
one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms .
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
but what i want to say , is , do n't you ever get drunk .
`` from mr. collins !
we have determined on following him thither .
they got a posse together .
she could think of nothing else .
is a mystery : for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer .
but as we are certain it can not be so .
you dare not .
aunt polly .
that there was a time .
but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all .
tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it .
`` this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
`` i am sure there is not on his .
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun . ''
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham .
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
`` at such a time , so dark , so dreary , for human sympathy my very spirit sighed .
and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell , injun joe jumped with the knife and. ``
but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often .
they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on .
i presume , '' said miss bingley.. `` and pray what is the result ? ''
`` whatever i do is done in a hurry , '' replied he .
in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable .
if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple , tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away .
and while sir william accompanied him .
but the strongest of the citizens continued searching .
`` take whatever you like , and get away . ''
i was first made acquainted .
the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time .
leading the way through every walk and cross walk .
but there are two things that i want very much to know : .
he always divided up with 'em perfectly square . ''
`` come to think , becky , we are away down below them .
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?
under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants .
`` i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . ''
and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank .
i play with frogs so much that i 've always got considerable many warts .
`` and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . ''
mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .
and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas .
i can not consider your situation with much compassion . ''
now tom shivered from head to heel .
like that old humpbacked richard . ''
`` oh !
said .
said joe .
`` your friend performs delightfully . ''
give the rest of 'em the slip , and turn down through the lane and come back .
`` yes , '' replied wickham.. `` his estate there is a noble one .
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (
and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .
and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! ''
but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown .
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do !
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all .
for my part .
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .
oh , why did we ever leave the others ! ''
he bravely bore his miseries three weeks , and then one day turned up missing .
though .
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor . ''
but he wrote it again , nevertheless .
tom began to fear that huck was right .
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old .
will you go in there with me and help get it out ? ''
from his garden .
the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds .
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations .
yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
but he kept ahead all the time .
retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married .
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother .
two thousand verses is a great many .
she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's .
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure .
on the very beginning of our acquaintance .
counsel for the prosecution said : `` take the witness . ''
what was the name of its proprietor .
heavens , was everything lost !
`` set her back on the stabboard !
and well it might .
lady catherine might see him in her way through town .
how they sat there and cried for gladness .
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence .
they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock .
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him .
`` like it !
a body does just the same in a dream as he 'd do if he was awake .
i own .
i knew it to be a most respectable .
speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
but my goodness .
then tom turned coolly away , still talking , and took amy with him .
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''
and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .
as soon as tom got his breath he said : `` huck , it was awful !
while tom was eating his supper .
he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light .
they most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree .
there is nothing else to be done .
and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
for what do we live .
when elizabeth had read the note aloud .
why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?
some minutes later the widow 's guests were at the supper-table .
( by the bye , mrs. forster and me are such friends ! )
anyways it 's a goner for us , tom . ''
so i was determined he should know it .
observed mrs. bennet .
and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet .
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require . ''
`` yes , that 's it , huck .
`` indeed .
`` how strange ! ''
your house is on fire .
the frequent means of varying the humble home scene .
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .
i thank you . ''
`` you can now have nothing farther to say , '' she resentfully answered .
his pride never deserts him .
then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way .
on reaching the house .
she is well .
and she looked on the whole scene .
she told tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose .
then becky reflected a moment and said : `` but what will mamma say ? ''
scattered lights began to wink out .
though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable .
'' said wickham , `` as to his being agreeable or otherwise .
`` we will ask you no questions . ''
were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets .
name your names . ''
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour .
and those which regulate the clergy .
he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one
to see .
`` they will join me early to-morrow .
this was satisfactory .
a feller do n't have only one chance for such a pile .
they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time .
if he fears me , why come hither ?
anybody can do it . ''
and kitty and lydia .
`` and you do talk such stuff , '' sid said .
a tumblebug came next .
and tom and becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome .
was scarcely the work of a moment.. i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view .
and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself .
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen .
`` behind the elms that 's on the edge of the grave . ''
also an old suspender , some bacon rind , and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls .
huck closed up and shortened his distance , now , for they would never be able to see him .
she put the jacket away , and stood by musing a minute .
huck 's scared voice answered in a low tone : `` please let me in !
'' said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
and you would , too , if you had one .
the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister .
who seems good humour itself .
which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .
hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face , but disappointment crossed him everywhere .
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well .
i saw it a minute ago . ''
`` indeed ! ''
where did you sit ? ''
there was silence for some time .
no , you need n't come , huck .
so tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on .
but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place .
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley's way . ''
i am ashamed of you !
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side .
and `` led up '' warily to opportunities for remark about becky .
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?
as she pointed to the contending elements without , and bade me contemplate the two beings presented . ''
and then rising up .
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again .
and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun .
`` friendship '' was one .
he cried .
but mr. darcy they had only seen at church .
though written solely for their benefit .
but .
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him .
hucky looked , with joy in his heart .
she cried .
and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .
but could not be admitted to the bedroom .
`` can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? ''
do n't wait .
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .
when he first applies for their favour .
`` but if he does it any more i shall certainly
indeed you must go .
and wickham .
to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection.. he left netherfield for london .
whose dislike of his general behaviour .
he pleaded for forgiveness .
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood .
a poor little sufferer , whose griefs were at an end .
though lydia 's short letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green .
`` infernal impudence ! ''
as it was no more than she expected .
the widder 's good to me , and friendly .
and therefore .
so i took the liberty of coming to ask . ''
mrs. bennet all amazement .
i have not yet learnt to condemn them.. with respect to that other .
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
in a moment he said : `` it 's all plain enough , now .
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
a most country town indifference to decorum . ''
as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane .
they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation .
of tom 's statement true .
`` what bark ? ''
presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl .
his rod and his ferule were seldom idle now .
`` it is a handsome face .
white , mulatto .
he was quite young .
did n't i , mary !
out in the cold world .
took the middle of the street .
only just one .
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted .
vexed and disappointed .
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .
`` more 's the pity .
presently huckleberry whispered with a shudder : `` it 's the devils sure enough .
stump and jam your hand in and say : 'barley-corn .
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
stay where you are.. you are charmingly group 'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .
and `` wall '' their eyes .
the next moment he was `` showing off '' with all his might .
i believe .
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .
oh !
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .
her father had most cruelly mortified her .
a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joe 's face .
`` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
bingley was quite uncomfortable .
at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley 's regard for me .
does it ? ''
i wo n't let it grieve me . ''
then she stamped her little foot and said : `` be so mean if you want to !
said her aunt .
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed .
`` could you see the rags by the light of the cigars ? ''
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .
why do n't you do it ?
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins 's correspondence for any consideration .
now .
as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , .
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode .
`` i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report .
who in comparison with the stranger , were become `` stupid , disagreeable fellows . ''
`` i found .
becky .
why do n't you fall ? ''
and the two fourth with maria lucas .
`` how so ?
well , she 's ben good friends to me , anyway . ''
for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .
mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows .
there was a very powerful motive for secrecy .
promised to reform over and over again .
he has more to give .
and now i 've got you , and you got to settle , you know ! ''
`` it 's all done , aunt . ''
but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ''
he naturally returned to all his former indolence .
there in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the `` ha'nted '' house .
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry .
a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
she turned to him and said .
the left hand began to describe circles .
but i forgive ye , tom .
`` now less fetch the guns and things , '' said huck .
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her .
how much you must have gone through ! ''
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
if you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations .
there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room .
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there .
but his manners recommended him to every body .
a touch of uncomfortable suspicion .
`` i reckon you do n't .
`` who ?
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all
a perfect willingness to accept it .
tom went home miserable , and his dreams that night were full of horrors .
then in the spelling class .
i have not the smallest hope .
and then fell into a moody jog .
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible .
distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom .
after welcoming their sisters .
make yourself easy about that !
`` yes .
he was to come there with wickham , you know .
`` you do ? ''
`` yours .
`` i remember .
i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success .
and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination .
`` no .
you must not disappoint your father . ''
`` i have heard much of your master 's fine person .
my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ''
he picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore .
tom learned of huck 's sickness and went to see him on friday .
of being admitted into her family again .
oh !
and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . ''
he was the proudest .
was there any use ?
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .
and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .
urged him so earnestly .
for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .
who .
we can find out quick . ''
'' said mrs. gardiner , `` but perhaps to the lakes . ''
by turns , as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere .
as you .
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge .
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way .
for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations .
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ''
'' replied darcy .
be assured .
the men would be captured and jailed that day .
and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
and he hastened away , hating her for it .
`` in what an amiable light does this place him ! ''
and she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued .
because if he 'd had one she 'd a burnt him out herself !
cuffing boys , pulling hair , making faces .
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet .
lizzy .
deliver a final mighty hurrah .
when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
against your reason , and even against your character ?
i want to be told whether i ought .
but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth .
and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .
but in all .
`` i feel myself called upon .
her favourite walk .
one-legged , in a precarious way and almost toppling over , first on one side and then on the other .
but with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward .
and it was only friday .
'' said elizabeth .
than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward .
`` my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? ''
i am very glad you liked her .
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .
`` then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , '' said mrs. bennet .
before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over .
and though feeling no reliance on her .
`` i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' cried elizabeth .
and then you must stay all night . ''
`` i dono .
as they drove to mr. gardiner's door , jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival .
but if you will listen to his letter .
but mary removed the towel and said : `` now ai n't you ashamed , tom .
`` i 'm agreed . ''
a great deal more passed at the other table .
by the way .
the children have been wanting me this half hour .
given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it .
but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing .
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be .
the girl glanced at the words , but made no sign .
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
twice she put out her hand to take the garment again , and twice she refrained .
and then her heart broke .
yet so rationally and so mildly .
tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs
everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable .
but neither could get an advantage .
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .
all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow .
and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal .
she found .
my dear , you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ''
you know i always speak my mind .
having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .
so he said in a whisper : `` hucky .
too good for the waiter , is not it ?
did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect 's need ?
your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance .
`` i am talking of possibilities , charles . ''
said he , as he joined her .
`` you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner .
four .
injun joe 's cup stands first in the list of the cavern 's marvels .
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . ''
fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick .
and who had been brought up to expect its exertion .
`` can you find the way , tom ?
took notice of some little alteration in it .
and preparing her to be surprised .
`` ah ! ''
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .
and lydia exclaimed.. other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce 's sermons .
`` but this was all lost upon me .
the last repetition was successful .
tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially .
in an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt , gripped together like cats .
she 'd like to see me in just such a fix .
'' said tom .
think they 'll see us ? ''
`` a great deal of good management , depend upon it .
`` good for ?
with driving rain , awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning .
easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well .
and abruptly reminded him of his promise .
and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes .
`` can it be possible that he will marry her ? ''
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin .
ben ranged up alongside of him .
they struck far off to the right .
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips .
and how joe said this and that small trifle ( pregnant with awful prophecy .
it became her turn to listen .
`` when would they miss us , tom ? ''
and immediately .
that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only `` hooking .
how strange must it appear to him !
she thrust it away .
and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long .
clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling .
more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away .
or old metal ? ''
she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her .
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .
but she contented herself with `` and one .
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence .
but some other time . ''
his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before .
who was on his knees in the corner , now , digging with his bowie-knife .
only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick
he blushed , now , and his eyes fell .
but anyway , your mother would miss you as soon as they got home . ''
`` and besides , look-a-here .
looked eagerly round the room .
he looked serious as usual .
`` it 's to swear to stand by one another .
his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer .
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .
you'll see . ''
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court . ''
`` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
they were all astonished .
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .
my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .
`` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .
now , and that the search had been given over .
london : printed for t. egerton , military library , whitehall .
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which .
she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam 's and mr. darcy 's having both spent three weeks at rosings .
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley and talked of mrs. darcy may be guessed .
in her dressing gown .
i do n't believe they 'll bother us .
there was now employment for the whole party .
during three days tom was deeply concerned about the judge 's condition and hungry for news of it .
there 's for you !
you notch her ears like a sow ! ''
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .
tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom , but invariably heard distressing news .
`` yet shame i not to bear an o'erfull heart , nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes .
read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .
elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother .
`` no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose .
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin .
& c. & c. '' mr. gardiner did not write again .
then cried a little , then did both together .
but mrs. bennet , was not so well pleased with it .
when a sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech .
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . ''
`` but , joe , there ai n't such another swimming-place anywhere . ''
seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight .
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time .
and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently .
but that gentleman , '' looking at darcy , `` seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ''
and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils .
she ran to the door .
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town .
aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly .
mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england .
he looked for a moment at elizabeth .
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far .
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .
`` well , midnight 's good , anyway , tom . ''
if not to himself .
on receiving amongst the thanks of the table .
and when the subject was revived the next morning .
shire militia removed from meryton ?
to think of something .
and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest .
his smartness of the morning had seemed to tom a good joke before , and very ingenious .
tom was silent a moment .
was perfectly aware .
a flirt of the poodle 's head .
mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield .
we ai n't doing any harm .
occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils .
honest injun , now .
but he soon gave that up .
`` why , yes , everybody that 's in love with each other .
giving orders , delivering judgments , discharging directions here , there , everywhere that he could find a target .
but elizabeth .
and fifty after i am gone . ''
and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour .
there is a lady .
therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
morning came .
huck waited what seemed a weary long time , but nothing happened .
and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
this was invitation enough .
tom was introduced to the judge .
the boy stammered , gasped , and got it out : `` tom . ''
so jackson's island was chosen .
at a point where the mississippi river was a trifle over a mile wide .
therefore .
but his real reason had been the fear that not even the
unwilling to speak .
damn you . ''
proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high .
chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which
they won't hender us from digging there in the daytime . ''
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .
'' she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured spelling-book .
as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read .
`` tell the gentleman your other name , thomas , '' said walters , `` and say sir .
or lose her reason .
move , now , and do n't leave any tracks behind you . ''
but this did not take place till after many a significant look
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .
he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr. dobbins had ever administered .
and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .
`` it did .
and be going right after that money . ''
but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room .
and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself .
the signal did not come the night before , so why should it be any more likely to come tonight ?
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world .
and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . ''
and say nothing of the bad .
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion .
and had so many favourites .
a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone .
`` i 'll tell you some time .
and wondered it had escaped her before .
both's right , like enough .
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion .
who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .
so vast a sum , all in actual cash , seemed next to incredible .
is there one among the sex .
for she went up stairs half an hour ago . ''
he found joe harper studying a testament , and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle .
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more .
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .
a measured , muffled snore issued from aunt polly 's chamber .
`` well , i know .
colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .
while i had the honour of dancing with you .
`` i am astonished .
then you won't ever get here .
which would exactly finish jane 's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
say .
and to have mr. collins instead !
`` she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ''
`` but it is a comfort to think that .
and there is not another woman in the room .
quite frightened maria lucas .
instead of winning him .
am i wrong .
my dear lizzy .
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to .
and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials .
he really believed .
i 'd run away . ''
the strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said : `` .
began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack
every body is disgusted with his pride .
he put his hoop away , and his bat .
it blowed the candle ! ''
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
my mother means well .
so he took up a rock , and if she had n't dodged , he 'd a got her .
two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night : `` blood ! ''
but as soon as he was gone .
the new boy stepped over promptly .
`` and they 'd do it , too . ''
without any reference to any other account .
i 'll give you a white alley ! ''
but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security .
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions .
did she call to refuse her consent ? ''
in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy .
at the request of mr. bennet .
that drop was falling when the pyramids were new .
feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence .
from the sideboard to the fender .
and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer .
`` no 'm . ''
you have a sweet room here , mr. bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .
tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable
at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle , and voices shouted , `` it 's him !
always ? ''
`` in spirit. ``
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money .
but really talking to mr. bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford .
elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .
the boys drew a long , grateful breath .
which though it spoke compassion .
with your eyes shut , and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody .
and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands .
and then struck through the woods , following the shore , with streaming garments .
your sister i also watched.. her look and manners were open .
`` well , i bet it is .
then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon huck 's spirits like a mountain .
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes .
`` no , now . ''
but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane 's . ''
he said. ``
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father .
the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped , confused .
for herself she was humbled .
than that they were just returned from the library .
`` perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson .
`` oh , hundreds of times .
for though they each .
with the son of his patron .
`` i am by no means of opinion .
`` i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ''
'' said jane , `` that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .
and within half a year from these events .
and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable .
mr. darcy looked up .
what a good joke it will be !
charlotte 's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness .
with some dismal ceremonies and incantations .
making even closer snatches at it with his teeth , and jerking his head till his ears flapped again .
and leave the treasure ? ''
degrees till these words were revealed : `` i love you . ''
the boy could not have shown a wilder , heartier interest , if she had built a fire under him .
but it is not sound .
back of her head for the space of a minute .
resentment against his enemies .
you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church .
`` well .
his aunt would pull it out , and that would hurt .
'' said he .
`` but i dreamt about you , anyway .
`` oh !
human nature is so prone to fall into it !
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ''
she even shook hands with the former.. elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .
`` gracechurch-street , sept. 6 .
my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .
and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .
what do i not owe you !
when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured .
startled mrs. bennet.. she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that
should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
says i .
`` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?
be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so .
`` well , what of that ?
`` yes , that 's so .
`` if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness .
they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight .
and was in a way to be very much in love .
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle .
and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping .
but elizabeth .
a fragment of chalk .
he would hang out no signals , he would take notice of none .
'' said she .
always gave me much uneasiness .
only let me assure you .
`` where 'd you get him ? ''
that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley 's regard .
`` but that expression of 'violently in love ' is so hackneyed .
i 'll tie her to the bed .
`` they are all silly and ignorant like other girls .
he had only thought it was not the treasure , however .
with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st. james 's .
mr. philips , appears to do so much credit to .
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .
and entreated permission to introduce his friend .
god 'll take care of him .
'' observed miss bingley .
her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way .
he held his candle aloft and said : `` look as far around the corner as you can .
than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .
now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself .
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together .
`` it must have been his sister 's doing .
mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
consider how important every moment is , in such a case . ''
that their niece was taken suddenly ill.. but satisfying them instantly on that head .
`` why , tom , it 'll take all summer . ''
tom begged her to pluck up hope again , and she said she could not .
under the cross .
but she is nothing to me now .
from the idea it suggested of something more.. it now first struck her .
`` why , yes , i did , auntie .
or else there would n't be any style about it .
i do not trust my own partiality .
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .
'' said mr. bennet , `` and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply .
he had besides the things before mentioned .
nor lay down , nor roll around anywher 's .
his saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness .
upon his own judgment alone .
for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . ''
his heart was heavy .
she asked her at different times .
and tom let him up and said : `` now that 'll learn you .
'' `` the cathedral , '' `` aladdin 's palace , '' and so on .
and where are they gone ?
an ' so she tole me go 'long an ' 'tend to my own business .
though tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window .
the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .
`` tom , we got to keep mum .
jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to
i tell you , tom , i was most scared to death .
yet he knew to the contrary himself .
there was something in that .
nothing at all .
what shall we do with him ?
in strict confidence , how tom had taken her whipping at school , the judge was visibly moved .
'' said she .
they may wish many things besides his happiness .
`` less start right off , tom . ''
he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .
`` yes , and my pa 's going to take me again some time , if i 'm good . ''
cried mrs. gardiner .
and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it .
and as she recalled his very words .
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady 's attention .
`` could i expect it to be otherwise ! ''
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion .
and mrs. collins 's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .
it roused no smile .
and under your orders . ''
shake hands .
`` milksop ! ''
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory .
the officers will find women better worth their notice .
mrs. bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .
and that night the judge suffered a relapse and died .
and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.. but no , '' .
plain affair , with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple .
about ten or a dozen years ago .
how much have you done ? ''
that .
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire .
and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
assumed a tragic expression .
and when he ceased .
`` benjamin rogers , did you tear this book ? ''
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together .
emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth , and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes .
than any dislike of the proposal .
no ! ''
`` now .
replied kitty , `` it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .
she made some slight observation on the dance .
`` i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .
conscience-smitten , too .
`` how long did you say that he was at rosings ? ''
she really rejoiced at it .
not that i am afraid of myself , but i dread other people 's remarks . ''
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .
and he wandered away a dismantled hero .
`` then sid he said .
aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse .
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
his father .
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family .
flooding him with his blood .
i do not deserve it .
she resisted .
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ''
and where he was reduced to meet .
`` you are quite right .
five seconds .
was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod .
but i dare not hope it .
but bob tanner did . ''
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
`` somebody 's drownded ! ''
`` a great many indeed , '' said her companion with a sigh .
`` then how you going to know which one to go for ? ''
accordingly .
by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players .
`` dear madam .
and though by no means so clever as herself .
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .
he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house .
`` both , '' replied elizabeth archly .
she could not make a very favourable answer .
he 's asleep , poor wreck .
after her elder sister has resigned it .
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended .
and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung , the very same evening .
there 's another that you 're more beholden to than you are to me and my boys .
`` but it is fortunate , '' thought she , `` that i have something to wish for .
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself .
and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn
i will go directly to mr. bennet .
and on her pausing .
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .
mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted .
as if from a spring-board : shall i be car-ri-ed toe the skies .
but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit .
was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
i mend pens remarkably well . ''
he spoke well .
that was a wise thought .
like the writer of this book .
but the giddy lad never could see the bait .
`` remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do . ''
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ''
`` mary and kitty have been very kind .
that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge .
such flutterings .
and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect , and she was nodding over her knitting .
`` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''
yes , there was something in that .
'' and were not intended to mean anything in particular .
we are only off being pirates , ' and put it on the table by the candle .
`` i shall not say that you are mistaken .
or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away . ''
and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum .
after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks .
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false .
nowadays , like they used to in old times , but a pirate 's always respected .
and any time i ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it .
and then wended toward headquarters to report .
`` i wanted to run away , but i could n't seem to come anywhere but here . ''
and besides , he always has .
lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter .
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
risk any thing rather than her displeasure .
because he had n't any aunt . ''
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton .
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable .
`` read it aloud .
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone . ''
but anyway they do n't come around in the daytime .
a good humoured girl .
supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order .
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .
but they never stopped at the quarry .
have i been asleep ? ''
that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former .
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .
`` you may readily comprehend .
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse .
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .
had he done his duty in that respect .

lordy , tom , we 're goners !
depended less on any single event .
the next morning , however , made an alteration .
`` well , what ? ''
when the letters were read .
he was on the ground floor and there were no guards .
mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt 's ill breeding , and made no answer .
and begging pardon .
jane looked at her doubtingly .
to assure to your daughter .
there was a song in every heart .
`` your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me .
`` not so much as i could wish , sir .
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
several pupils had a few yellow tickets , but none had enough .
rewards had been offered , the country had been scoured , but no injun joe was found .
and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the

he drifted listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected .

of how tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him .
and had stuck to the denial from principle .
thronged around it , joined its homeward march , and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah !
but the shortness of her stay .
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted .
the window ain't high from the ground . ''
while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village .
wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed .
but none of them were cross-examined by potter 's lawyer .
he means to be severe on us .
it 's injun joe ! ''
such a charming man ! .
thought she .
there was no sound .
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive .
`` how near it may be to mine .
i never see him get around so since. ``
and before he had .
but tom said : `` hold on !
exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man .
and indeed so i do still at my heart .
without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him . ''
and the girls smiled on each other .
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility .
mrs. gardiner .
but it ought to be done .
the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind .
and yet whether bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference .
`` and so was i . ''
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart .
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .
there was a late look in the light , a late sense in the atmosphere .
that a person who can write a long letter .
such spasms in my side .
to counterbalance these advantages .
it 's revenge ! ''
therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .
tom went first , cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended .
oh , i know .
at least that he might at least mean nobody but tom , since only tom had testified .
and she put her hand on tom 's head and said gently : `` i was meaning for the best .
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill. '' lydia declared herself satisfied .
peter was sure .
we 're right together . ''
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both .
and that there are very few of us who do not cherish
it was an evening of no common delight to them all .
there was still less to be learnt .
`` good idea .
and she tried to believe she was glad of it , but she found she was not certain .
what 's that ? ''
it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy .
you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time . ''
'' cried bingley .
was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in any thing .
from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas .
how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line .
the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley .
but at last she was still , only moaning a little in her sleep .
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game .
if he were already self-destined to another .
`` your humility , mr. bingley , '' said elizabeth , `` must disarm reproof . ''
she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine .
her uncle and aunt were all amazement .
the miss webbs all play .
if you 'll believe me .
`` number two .
`` all right , you wait and see .
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet 's ill humour or ill health .
and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.. your 's , & c. `` e .
but she was proud of him .
he is very much in love with her friend . ''
only the biggest boys , and young ladies of eighteen and twenty , escaped lashing .
the stirring event was well canvassed .
`` that will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable .
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ''
you and the girls may go .
generous prayer it was .
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him .
but since we see every day that where there is affection .
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet .
presuming , however .
she sat down .
turn of our minds.. we are each of an unsocial .
envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee .
though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world .
you 'll look back .
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged .
no one was to be put in competition with him .
but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune .
but her conclusion was false .
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun .
then replied : `` of burglar 's tools .
after a few minutes reflection .
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .
`` do you suppose them to be in london ? ''
removed from the influence of lydia 's example .
for they were but heedless lads , like their generation , and had made no provision against rain .
said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''
`` what did you come for , then ? ''
`` i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .
and mrs. hurst .
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned .
`` do you ?
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .
'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' .
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject .
the feelings which .
but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed .
her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man .
the less there is to justify a traditional custom , the harder it is to get rid of it .
for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation .
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .
his letter was soon dispatched .
so we always do .
the themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them .
but attended with all that embarrassment which .
he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him .
and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction .
and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself .
`` but it must be done . ''
presently the welshman said : `` my boy , do n't be afraid of me .
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins .
`` i almost envy you the pleasure .
she will not be able to help calling . ''
mr. bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .
`` by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter .
the master was gathering his wrath .
it was first broken by mrs. annesley .
and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .
just a trifle louder .
becuz you know mighty well you ca n't .
and will save all the best of the covies for you . ''
tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said : `` there .
let your outside turn over slow !
and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .
`` you do n't have to get up .
the public were profoundly concerned .
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health .
the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet .
than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .
that bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
no man `` knew '' the cave .
has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
we 've got it now .
one must speak a little , you know .
`` i do not know .
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia 's connections .
console lady catherine as well as you can .
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ''
and you can not imagine how well he looked !
as the weather was fine .
and by that means .
and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
but now their sayings were treasured and repeated .
tom choked off and whispered : `` look , hucky , look !
that was it !
he could number the fields in every direction .
`` good .
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .
and having examined his patient .
the widow douglass .
`` by all means , '' cried bingley .
`` well , what would you do ? ''
the howling stopped .
`` well , that 's funny , '' said tom .
but it was not to be .
chow-ow-ow !
huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered .
tom believed it must be tuesday by this time .
the girl said : `` it 's ever so nice .
the cardiff hill episode sank into instant insignificance .
when all her views were overthrown .
to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary .
yes .
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .
but after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior .
then there was a unanimous call for an explanation .
then she left .
had they been indifferent .
`` money !
go on ! ''
and she thought .
`` this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive .
`` when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ''
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . ''
mr. bingley arrived .
and then when we came away it was such fun !
she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married .
though .
when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham .
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane .
did you see him while you were at lambton ?
how much i shall have to tell ! ''
who did he rob ? ''
that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .
`` i am afraid you do not like your pen .
and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
elizabeth .
unable to support herself .
formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .
my friend , you 'll help me in this thing .
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
they made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with .
`` certainly . ''
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions .
sir william had been delighted with him .
bingley ? ''
or under a dead tree that 's got one limb sticking out .
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent .
as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men .
it was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms .
'bingley .
stirred him up with his foot and said : `` here !
gardiner . ''
every object in the next day 's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth .
by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels .
but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ''
of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .
`` i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , '' replied elizabeth .
and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor .
`` lizzy .
what has that got to do with it ? ''
it and tom 's persuasions presently carried the day .
my dear .
he said : `` huck do n't need it .
i hoped to find you reasonable .
`` rubbage !
`` yes .
look at your hands .
hilarious .
too .
he is come .
they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .
the middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage .
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !
for the first time .
speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall .
and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him ?
who .
and with wasted health and imbittered heart .
`` what 's verdigrease ? ''
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going .
she struck it to the floor .
in due form .
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr .
that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him .
and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
they all said they had not noticed whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip .
mr. collins made his declaration in form .
after honestly telling her what she thought .
but enough of this .
as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper .
huck .
they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room .
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family .
the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will .
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .
and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone .
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility .
it was the cool gray dawn .
`` i think you are in very great danger of making

distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter .
her ladyship received them civilly .
but .
tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction .
you blamed me for coming ? ''
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures .
a long dispute followed this declaration .
`` yes . ''
it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain .
and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground .
she talks awful , but talk do n't hurt .
and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly .
in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in .
he likes me , becuz i do n't ever act as if i was above him .
and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast .

that 's it .
would she drop one little tear upon his poor .

it would have suited me in every respect . ''
there was a gate .
`` sounds right .
oh , that i knew how it was ! ''
secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in .
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony.. if it be not so , let mr. darcy contradict it .
it would have been strange if they had .
but his face lit up .
and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . ''
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . ''
on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
`` i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . ''
it was mr. collins 's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened .
that .
when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .

halfway up the hill , without hesitating , and still climbed upward .

said grace miller .

away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .
he took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles .
he did not go skipping and prancing .
after a short silence .

`` there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
it is almost past belief .

with due consideration for the advantage of all your family .

though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible .
is not he a charming man ?
and saying to kitty .
and she was again applied to .
tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time .
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .
the gratitude .
tom was a free boy again , however .
but thursday night promised better .
this was one point .
it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends .
said mr. gardiner .
once was enough .

its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines .
they saw the housekeeper coming towards them .
and then there came , mingling with his half-formed dreams , a most melancholy caterwauling .
and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it .
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .
but i knew not .
you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention .
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him .
`` it 's a dirty business , '' said joe , without moving .
'' said he .
tom scrawled on his slate , `` please take it .
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere .
but he 's kind of good .
the wind did blow something .
the bell rang once more .
`` it 's p'ison .
then tom whispered : `` say , hucky .

in that he envied huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition , and was under strict orders not to play with him .

and turning round .

but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong .

he had been drowned while trying to escape , perhaps .

it added to the hope of the future .
`` forms of political government compared and contrasted '' .
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy .
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .

that i recommended another young person .

she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .

`` i dono .

but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities .
and sank into a pew , just as aunt polly , talking briskly with a friend , passed by .
at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished .
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .

when the party broke up .
he 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before i get my dander up .
and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips..

as it was certain .
`` i 'd know it better if you acted more like it . ''

the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .

which was bedroom , breakfast-room , dining-room , and library , combined .
she clung to him .

you have employed your time much better .
`` my dear , dear aunt , '' she rapturously cried , `` what delight !
and so on .
though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .
and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories .

where there was a nice sheltered path .
talents which rightly used .
said susy harper .

disclosing a rude bow and arrow .
oh !
then a deep , sullen boom came floating down out of the distance .
`` then .
but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire .
`` he did not talk to me of his own arts , '' said fitzwilliam smiling .
`` tom , i reckon they 're all alike .
how some men came along in a skiff and tom hailed
tom glanced at injun joe 's iron face and his tongue failed him .
a muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard .
`` my ma 's going to let me have one . ''
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .
and whenever he came to hunsford .
who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?
and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come ?
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me .
before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .
every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy .
he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder .
`` that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , '' said elizabeth .
however , it seemed well worth while to chance it , so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit .
he had yielded to his brother-in-law 's intreaty that he would return to his family .
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .
`` oh , you do n't want to see ! ''
miss bennet had slept ill .
the boys thought of the closet , but their strength was gone .
but the echoes must have disguised the voice .
`` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
could be good enough for a man .
though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire .
as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday .
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief .
a strange sadness rested upon her features .
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour .
you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard
said to elizabeth .
as you were mounting your horse .
i can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .
and the boys separated , each feeling wealthier than before .
`` what is it you mean ? ''
`` of the very great disadvantage to us all .
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome .
for what becomes of the moral .
and i knowed you had n't got the money becuz you 'd ' a ' got at

which was now to be settled .
can it be really so !
and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild .
you are safe from me . ''
went on thinking .
followed by sid and mary .
good heaven !
and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining .
when it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight , he heard the clock strike ten !
`` but i can assure you .
you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin .
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do .
hatred had vanished long ago .
threw a real gloom over their domestic circle .
i might n't be able alone .
`` let 's go and see . ''
`` yes , indeed , '' cried mrs. bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
she cried .
that they were afraid , for a moment , to venture in .
and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .
`` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
did you hear that ? ''
to own the truth , with wickham ! .
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband .
that was it .
but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . ''
of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won .
an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope .
and you meow back , if you get a chance .
`` it must not be thought of .
elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins .
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him .
and tom would not have parted with either for a circus .
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .
was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .
and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him .
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .
a cry of `` scat !
during dinner time .
`` good gracious !
`` she will drop the acquaintance entirely . ''
another denial .
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .
guessed what it meant .
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased .
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept .
the pride of her heart , and were built for `` style , '' not service .
i just knowed it . ''
i had not believed it possible . ''

said not a word of wishing to see me again .
and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .
without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .

`` perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .
and had she been able to receive them into her house .
had had some little curiosity , but it was rather feeble .
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield .
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn .

`` becky '' .
she received him with her very best politeness .
but he will vouch for the good conduct .
`` only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings , and such like .

and tell her. ``

the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .

on miss bingley 's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes .
you supposed more than really existed .
maybe , but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom .
`` dear sir , `` i must trouble you once more for congratulations .
desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .
she tasted it and was filled with gratitude .
and she rose as she spoke .
and they get slathers of money .
all over me .
she had the same story to repeat every day .
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon .
and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for .
tom's reflections grew oppressive .
to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather , as became outlaws .
i ca n't keep the run of 'em .
by jings , do n't you wish you was jeff ? ''
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow .
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on .
and for whatever cause .
of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done .
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
than she had been in the way of procuring .
the denial only seemed to make the thing worse for tom .
how could their charms work till midnight ? .
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive .
he wo n't desert .
they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood .
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday .
'' he added .
the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with .
but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
this room was my late master 's favourite room .
and i could see you and hear every word you said .
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world .
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's .
`` come here , child , '' cried her father as she appeared .
`` if i .
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
and then what ?
`` i could n't help it .
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her
i 'm hungry , too .
`` say , huck .
far from the section usually traversed by tourists .
it 's all owing to the good superintendent .
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ''
it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
`` removed ! ''
and i hope among different people .
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them .
glorified , until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement .
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point .
`` they have none of them much to recommend them , '' replied he .
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident .
are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ''
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
and then said : `` the ha'nted house .
`` oh , but ai n't you glad now we're here ! ''
it was yet a well known fact that .
for he was measuring , tom said .
and will probably be much talked of .
and welcome ! ''
as she had heard no carriage .
open your mouth .
he put his hand on his jacket pocket .
`` oh , goody .
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent .
thank god !
`` to oblige you .
doing all the heroic things he could conceive of .
that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.. attention .
and she walked on , crying .
mingling with a very good opinion of himself .
of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .
`` if i were as rich as mr. darcy .
then the small raft had been missed .
and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement .
and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper .
because they were not immediately before me.. these causes must be stated .
when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
should be removed from society so little pleasing to either .
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love .
now stir out of this and we 'll go to digging . ''
home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were .
`` oh , that will be fun ! ''
since nothing would do them but to be rid of him , let it be so .
coming ... . here they are .
but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this .
he was directly invited to join their party .
to make them his parting obeisance .
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster 's .
then the girl's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else .
the prime feature of the evening was in order , now .
and company there ?
i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it .
three of 'em !
and her face grew white , too , and her lip trembled .
huck 's joy was quenched .
and has learnt the rest from that friend himself .
where such and such officers had attended them .
she went on .
but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort
was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate .
restless and uneasy .
and .
and maybe these men were going to murder her .
`` why .
sad at heart , lazy with the summer softness and the quiet , weary of captivity , sighing for change .
tom said : `` oh .
no , it was what he was promised .
all right , though .
your children 's alone , '' and she took wing and went off to see about it .
an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .
i reckon we can get along without him , per'aps . ''
but permit me to say that there must be a wide

as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .
aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .
unexpectedly meet mr. darcy.. she felt all the perverseness of the
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added .
`` my dear sir .
after lamenting it however at some length .
& c. '' miss bingley 's congratulations to her brother .
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . ''
huck scanned his own clothing forlornly .
led the way across the street .
and two younger boys .
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb , throwing handsprings , standing on his head .
had not it been for her own perverseness .
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
`` i do n't know .
it is really too distressing .
he was very fond of them . ''
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
`` yes , sir . ''
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
whilst tears filled the eyes of both .
there was a sharp yelp .
and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
before they are packed up .
though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly
but .
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself .
and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards .
extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature .
in meryton they parted .
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ''
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town .
you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
she opened the door .
the boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom .
`` the present always occupies you in such scenes .
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book .
her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite . ''
he was fond of the country and of books .
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece .
when bingley 's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .
unfeeling , selfish girl !
for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord .
for interrupting you .
hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight .
his belief of her sister's insensibility .
he gathered himself up cursing , and his comrade said : `` now what 's the use of all that ?
she had not been many hours at home .
`` i did not know that you intended to walk .
`` that is right.. you could not have started a more happy idea .
sir.. and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
she requested to have a note sent to longbourn .
determined if possible to find out .
it's dangerous . ''
`` yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word . ''
for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls .
`` do they hop ? ''
go on , tom ! ''
but i overheard him tell auntie today about it .
and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed .
he proceeded to inform them .
`` go for all of 'em ! ''
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question .
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner .
the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! `` .
what has been sometimes found before .
that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .
her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
not a soul knew of it .
but not her .
when they found out what they had driven him to , perhaps they would be sorry .
all along i 've been wanting to be a robber .
. ``
in short .
what did you take there ? ''
`` i hope not so .
he said to himself , `` now it 's coming ! ''
but he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand .
scarcely recollected her interest in the affair .
neither could any thing be urged against my father .
it was muff potter .
`` you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ''
found his piece of bark safe .
for poor sailors , tossed by stormy seas .
the tears lay very near the surface .
but no such recollection befriended her .
and yourself .
or humbling myself .
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing
( my father particularly .
of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .
where she feared most to fail .
there comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy 's life when he
`` what is his name ? ''
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know .
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley . ''
you take their watches and things , but you always take your hat off and talk polite .
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
`` all right , then .
the moment he was gone .
it could not dwell long on her spirits .
the. ``
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .
and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
and on these occasions .
and sometimes i ca n't sleep much .
i wanted to yesterday .
throwing rocks at me and says 'dern that cat ! '
lodged against the missouri shore some five or six miles below the village .
they 'd mean you , huck .
if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
and read it through with a relish .
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte .
and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford .
well .
my youngest of all .
but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
i do n't want to stay home from school . ''
without supposing them .
do n't be afraid . ''
she was not rendered formidable by silence .
`` the country , '' said darcy , `` can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .
take yourselves off .
breast to breast , they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond .
in what manner he thought of her .
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource .
sir !
`` yes .
pray write instantly , and let me understand it .
`` mr. darcy is all politeness , '' said elizabeth , smiling .
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !
pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy , they 're a-witching you .
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.. of neither darcy nor wickham could she think .
`` indeed you are mistaken .
`` well , he 's mended kites for me , huck , and knitted hooks on to my line .
from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended .
tom was out late , that night , and came to bed through the window .
since he was driven out into the cold world , he must submit .
with many rapturous expressions .
`` what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her . ''
if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner .
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent .
leave it .
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her .
who art thou that .
this one makes it sing mighty small , i'm willing to allow . ''
and what do you think she said besides ?
there was not a sound .
`` why , he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was . ''
then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down .
then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air .
when in a happy humour .
what did i tell you ?
but i confess they would have no charms for me .
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind .
a log raft in the river invited him .
who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook .
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house .
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge .
kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach .
that is , with a marriage .
which passed to her .
`` have you got one of them papers , tom ? ''
river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour .
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .
and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound .
yes .
`` ye .
`` i have never heard him say so .
these details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating .
she had never heard of his having had any relations .
millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them .
and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .
and the piano-forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them .
but the ladies were ready enough to talk .
and .
can you get out ? ''
`` except , '' thought elizabeth , `` when she goes to ramsgate . ''
his gratitude was measureless .
`` well , so much the better .
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .
`` tom , do n't lie to me .
`` would you believe it .
he trotted along awhile .
tom groaned louder , and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe .
or indifferent .
and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud .
`` these offences might have been overlooked .
if it must be so , it must . ''
did you ?
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
`` yet it is hard .
that proud and repulsive as were his manners .
you could think to come all the way over here from
`` no , you , tom ! ''
now go 'long to school .
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face .
tom was disgusted .
as we went along .
2 and never found anything but whiskey .
is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .
the bent and venerable major and mrs. ward .
that might offer consolation to such distress.. but i will not torment you with vain wishes .
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
which could have led me before .
five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! .
`` la ! ''
and it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself
they will ruin your happiness .
though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come .
as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham .
it do n't make any difference whose land it 's on . ''
tom saw his opportunity .
but answered them very composedly.. lady catherine then observed .
however .
which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children .
hang kitty !
'tai n't so , is it ? ''
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ''
sid marvelled , but said nothing .
his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane .
so he said : `` no 'm .
yet notwithstanding all this , the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected .
`` neglect !
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . ''
`` huck finn the red-handed , and joe harper the terror of the seas . ''
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case .
he had followed them purposely to town .
it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement , i reckon .
and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
after a pause : `` huck , they could n't anybody get you to tell , could they ? ''
but i bet you jeff thatcher could n't . ''
and besides , that school's going to open , and i 'd a had to go to it .
'' said her mother resentfully , `` since we are not to visit . ''
no signal came that night .
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !
and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord .
to which tom responded with jeers .
there is but such a quantity of merit between them .
and though she could not hear a word of it .
from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs .
it 's awful to be tied up so .
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.. if it be so .
say , huck , i know another o ' them voices .
and fixed his hopes upon old judge frazer .
that 's it ! ''
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ''
but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high .
and when he comes to the right girl he 'll know it , without any telling .
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness .
`` tom , it do n't make no difference .
or are the result of previous study ? ''
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
the doctor murmured inarticulately , gave a long gasp or two and was still .
and you must feel .
elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced .
the widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings .
for his eye fell upon the stolid face of injun joe .
`` as often as i can .
and beg leave to apologise for it .
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended .
that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .
but say .
they said their prayers , and sid was soon asleep .
why is not every body as happy ? ''
till he had received an answer from colonel forster .
pummelling the air , and kicking and gouging .
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent .
and cracked his head soundly with her thimble .
that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?
`` what is it ? ''
take and bounce a rock off ' n your head . ''
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her .
not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh 's family.. do you play and sing .
he stooped and passed under .
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .
if the weather should happen to be cool .
`` lookyhere , huck , being rich ai n't going to keep me back from turning robber . ''
'' said the comrade .
that was an impossible thing .
he was now become .
this bosom friend was joe harper .
we are sorry enough for that .
with no expectation of pleasure .
and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , `` that will do extremely well , child .
change the meaning of principle and integrity .
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man .
sid , mary .
your tempers are by no means unlike .
that no man in his senses .
which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .
and tried to `` whistle her down the wind , '' but failed .
without distinction of color .
darcy mentioned his letter .
as soon as i get to town .
when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .
the village was illuminated .
tom decided that he could be independent of becky thatcher now .
better give it up . ''
in spite of having been at st. james 's .
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble .
they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time .
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself .
judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day .
and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
`` well .
and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .
huck would not explain .
but it was her business to be satisfied .
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley .
again expressed his sorrow for her distress .
and when immediately before my father 's death .
the other half he was afraid he would be .
she could not positively answer .
remarks were put forth in his hearing as `` feelers '' .
. ``
even for a dore bible ?
`` good heaven !
four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means .
and shake their heads , as much as to say , `` words can not express it .
that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it .
and .
as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do .
but let him in , lads , and let 's see what 's the trouble . ''
as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string .
and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill .
i know we dine with four and twenty families . ''
in desperation .
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself .
that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence .
`` she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property . ''
miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you .
tom being placed next the aisle .
for they talked `` by the book , '' from memory .
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .
for a whole day 's tte--tte between two women can never end without a quarrel .
felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before .
i must speak to hill , this moment . ''
`` no . ''
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr. collins .
and it 's a bully taw . ''
but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says .
and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession .
`` oh , that 's good .
`` it is a delightful thing .
especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ''
lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature .
a dozen would strain his capacity , without a doubt .
lest she should suffer from the change of room .
`` upon my word .
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?
and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning .
capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . ''
while in their cradles .
done in a flash , too !
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .
no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
horses were saddled .
they inwardly resolved to watch him nights .
boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all .
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . ''
and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
not merely for having once loved her .
her resentment gave way .
and dumb spaniard that 's been about town once or twice lately .
`` huck recollects it . ''
who said anything about killing ?
her graceful form , arrayed in snowy robes , is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance .
`` i would not be so fastidious as you are , '' cried bingley , `` for a kingdom !
`` that it ought not to be attempted .
i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ''
she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day .
aunt polly blushed crimson with humiliation , and frowned and shook her head at tom .
and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance .
that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking .
and though more astonished than gratified herself .
it originated in mrs. gardiner .
being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader .
well .
are now so widely different from what they were then .
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
`` how ? ''
that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again .
said aunt polly .
in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's .
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .
a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
while one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest .
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter .
i saw them the night before last . ''
but on this happy day .
to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them . ''
injun joe repeated his statement , just as calmly , a few minutes afterward on the inquest , under oath .
after sitting a few minutes .
`` it is from miss bingley , '' said jane , and then read it aloud .
at present i will say nothing about it . ''
they were honoured with a call from her ladyship .
whoever finds one of these hid treasures , it belongs to him .
she had very little notice from any but him .
every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment .
i feel it exceedingly , '' said lady catherine .
and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
in a frenzy of enjoyment , with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness .
what was the matter with you , tom ? ''
`` if we make haste .
and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
but none of the pirates smoked or '' chewed '' but himself .
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ''
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner .
of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast .
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .
then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping
and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
the treasure must be still in no .
though general way .
amy 's happy prattle became intolerable .
for not calling before .
indeed .
but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story .
where 'bouts is it , huck ? ''
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends .
she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor
at last he must be attending to those things .
the boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .
`` oh , shucks !
but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing .
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .
well , not very much . ''
presently they were shoulder to shoulder .

about eight years ago . ''
'' she added , `` i shall know how to understand it .
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness .
`` do you prefer reading to cards ? ''
`` what you got on your mind , tom ? ''
`` a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .
for it will make the surprise the greater .

) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss .
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before .
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? ''
one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent .
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed .
the ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice .
`` i 'd give the whole world to believe that .
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane .
muslin , and cambric .
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .
he was looking tolerably mellow .
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast .
with his mouth close to her ear .
about a fortnight after tom 's rescue from the cave .
school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them .
`` why , of course !
said her mother .
he said , in a low voice .
as the `` sold '' congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing
i have not that pain .
there was an angel there , somewheres ! ''
and t'other 's a mean-looking , ragged. ``
`` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .

but do n't imagine it was from any silly cause .
in the cave , by the twine clews they had strung behind them , and informed of the great news .
mr. bingley followed his advice .
he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys .
at the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard .
huck , if we find a treasure here , what you going to do with your share ? ''
you said you believed the door was open . ''
and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
so huck made pipes and filled them .
mr. bennet 's expectations were fully answered .
never been licked in school !
girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head .
extinguished for him to see her without some danger.. perhaps this concealment .
and straightway made his stealthy exit , latching the door behind him .
banging against furniture , upsetting flower-pots , and making general havoc .
but there were none now .
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .
kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke .
i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .
`` yes , that 's so , '' said huck .
and what can he have to say ? ''
her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty .
i thought there was more to it , maybe .
not exactly .
have a little compassion on my nerves .
but we'll play robin hood .
`` oh , yes .
as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study .
it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen .
joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
it was hours before he got to sleep .
`` that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had .
mr. wickham 's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer .
of course i ai n't going to tell old dobbins on this little fool .
the next moment two men brushed by him , and one seemed to have something under his arm .
this part of his intelligence .
connections .
she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
there was another communing silence .
ductility of his temper .
mary took him in hand .
`` what 's a ransom ? ''
pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together .
chow ! ''
`` just think of the fishing that 's here . ''
he threaded his way back to the ferry landing .
`` splendid !
but their bullets whizzed by and did n't do us any harm .
miss bennet .
`` my dear brother .
and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
'' she continued .
an excuse for not keeping his promise .
`` i think she will .
a few weeks , he believed .
and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance .
mr. bingley had not been of age two years .
by-and-by somebody shouted : `` who 's ready for the cave ? ''
and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones .
and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ''
he was seriously concerned .
for mcdougal 's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles
we 've got to do it tonight .
she saw an expression of general complaisance .
and look at your mouth .
his temptation is not adequate to the risk . ''
elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion .
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her 's .
`` any one with you ? ''
this was to knock off being pirates , for a while , and be indians for a change .
`` i mean .
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
at last frocks ceased to appear , and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps .
2 was a mystery .
what will become of me .
his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging .
and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
and then we 'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe .
`` you may well be surprised .
and how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate .
and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
'' the stranger observed .
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt .
and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again .
at a moment when the others were talking together .
i am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhere .
and it was soon done .
`` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the
and rising as she thus spoke .
and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .
he always brought his mother to church , and was the pride of all the matrons .
to whom the chief of this news had been given before .
`` yes , very well .
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone .
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
in short .
and sail through the open window , carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him .
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman 's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , .
and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.. he carved .
huck had made another terrible mistake !
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .
`` if .
have not you always hated him ? ''
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him .
there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .
a shake of the head .
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here .
at length .
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you .
not merely from the presence of such a mistress .
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone .
she was met in the vestibule by lydia .
and she turned , with her nose in the air , and he heard her say : `` mf !
sometimes she sews it with white , and sometimes she sews it with black .
in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil .
`` i do too '' said huck `` i 'd give heaps to know who it is . ''
`` compared with some families , i believe we were .
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument .
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .
but the latter half .
i thought we never should have got into the coach .
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets .
i should infinitely prefer a book . ''
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up .
and opening it with the utmost impatience .
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .
she resurrected nothing but the cat .
but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .
`` do let us have a little music , '' .
a thought shot like lightning through tom 's brain .
you need n't ever turn your hand over . ''
`` i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , '' cried elizabeth .
we 'll wait for you when we get to shore . ''
the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse .
but pride .
`` maybe they 're hunting for us now , tom . ''
for though the chief of his concerns .
what does he say ?
we have fastened this awful crime , beyond all possibility of question , upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar .
they were her state pair .
their visitors staid with them above half an hour .
whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her .
as they could easily see now ! ) .
diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it .
who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment .
open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible .
but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ''
did not i mention it to you ?
i wisht i hadn't come . ''
and said to colonel fitzwilliam .
it 's the truth .
when they were all in the drawing-room .
and then i reckon nobody 'll ever know much about who done this business . ''
but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way .
he was used to be free from them there .
you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .
to give to what was going forward in his family .
`` that would be a good scheme .
`` swimming 's no good .
all i know , is , it suits tom sawyer . ''
reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her .
`` very , very much .
is it true ? ''
the splendor of it was beyond all imagination !
here was a vague possibility .
and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions .
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest .
and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off .
against the boat 's swell , and the voyage was begun .
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . ''
she may lose the opportunity of fixing him .
s ' h't !
he would collect his resources together .
i am certain .
they found one presently , and tom said it was time to rest again .
received soon afterwards material relief .
'' said she , `` i should not care about it myself .
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .
and immediately accounting for it herself .
that of suitableness as companions .
tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch .
before this period of his life .
'' said he .
but this is the true one .
said elizabeth .
`` tom ! ''
'' cried her brother , `` he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins .
the next moment the master faced the school .
in that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat .
but his father 's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life .
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .
with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage .
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly .
and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .
jane heard them with horror .
and i can not help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .
the gentlemen came .
when school broke up at noon .
then the sobs came thick and fast .
he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday .
darcy . ''
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go .
my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham .
but he soon afterwards said , `` i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .
and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .
aunt polly came , and tom and sid and mary sat with her .
it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .
after tea .
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about .
it was not long before her mother gave her to understand
tom , never mind the bats , let 's go back that way !
my sisters may write to me .
and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .
who walked across the room .
`` he is certainly a good brother , '' said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .
they ai n't going to hurt us .
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .
then he bent over and kissed the faded lips .
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.. `` i assure you .
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
hideous with paint .
and besides all this .
and because all their children admired him so .
and as soon as mr. walters ' speech was finished , he introduced them to the school .
and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she 'd do .
and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon .
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers .
brighton .
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings .
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give .
lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter .
he said : `` i know what it is .
at length .
but nothing can be done .
'' said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , `` as ever i saw .
lady catherine de bourgh 's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .
when mr. collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed .
the wish is certainly to his credit . ''
( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library .
her regard had all the warmth of first attachment .
i won't betray you . ''
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides .
instead of making any answer .
`` a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever . ''
`` oh !
it only shews her being deficient in something herself .
a tremendous whack came down on tom 's shoulders , and its duplicate on joe 's .
it was to this effect : `` since writing the above .
and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c. mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted .
and at the inns in barnet and hatfield .
we 'll drop this thing for today , and play .
and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !
happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .
and he did `` tackle it again '' .
`` you could not have made me the offer of your hand in
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
just as they were about to move on .
i came to try you .
what is your own opinion ? ''
you was a prophesying .
shire were in general a very creditable .
that would be the greatest misfortune of all ! .
and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .
joe grumbled awhile .
`` most willingly . ''
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
`` how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . ''
one needle carried white thread and the other black .
no scruples in sinking mr. darcy 's character .
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure .
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject .
with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . ''
he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . ''
and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again .
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility .
and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town .
2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley
as becky was passing by the desk .
but you know married women have never much time for writing .
our respectability in the world .
were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike .
but the person who advanced .
nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth .
that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now .
and if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen
he erased it once more and then took himself out of
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea .
when we met at pemberley .
and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
whether any of them were likely to be married .
their affectionate mother shared all their grief .
`` that 's it ! ''
and thirdly .
the housekeeper came .
`` what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ? `` .
a moment or two more and they had gone altogether .
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .
the captive had broken off the stalagmite .
`` i 've seen 'em and they do n't . ''
and the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer , and clasped his appealing hands .
`` that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
i am glad he is gone .
and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds .
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate .
`` the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away .
not that i think charlotte so very plain .
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
do not repeat what i then said .
whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . ''
`` if anybody tells , let muff potter do it , if he 's fool enough .
`` my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , '' said charlotte .
this thought broke her down , and she wandered away , with tears rolling down her cheeks .
attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her .
and why not to me ?
no officers , no news could be sought after.. the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him .
could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself .
she added , `` by far too much .
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .
and wickham .
`` your coming to longbourn .
as truly as i wished it in reason.. my objections to the marriage were not merely those .
even `` aladdin 's palace '' can not rival it .
he 's full of the old scratch , but laws-a-me !
to care for none beyond my own family circle .
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him .
and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness .
said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance : `` well , tom sawyer he licked me once . ''
but it ai n't reasonable .
`` lady catherine de bourgh , '' she replied , `` has very lately given him a living .
mr. philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .
had noticed that there was a light in there the night before .
`` huck , i always reckoned we 'd get it .
i depend on you for that . ''
and be done with it all .
the harpers .
that was tom 's great secret .
he is so excessively handsome !
`` sir ! ''
mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it .
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .
i believe it 's better ' n to be a pirate . ''
he thought he would satisfy himself on that point .
she had been watching him the last hour .
'' said she .
he is a most interesting young man .
in my own case .
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied .
look behind you , aunt ! ''
each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform .
but he never bothered the poor .
the candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice .
`` ai n't it gay ? ''
but when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment .
do not be afraid of my running into any excess .
they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes .
i 'm willing .
but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine .
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . ''
it was the second week in may .
meantime , no matter how widely they had been separated .
however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .
but he said he `` 'lowed '' to `` lay '' for that boy .
`` when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? ''
in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .
and her features are not at all handsome .
if i 'd a knowed this was all , i 'd a learnt long ago . ''
the audience listened breathless , but the words refused to come .
my last letter had never reached her .
which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
the air was utterly dead .
from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed
scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails .
`` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
oh , tom , this is awful . ''
she poured out her terrors , her unavailing regrets , and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter .
been the only sacrifice .
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley .
this roused a general astonishment .
when he stood before the murdered man .
and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .
a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause .
things are settled so oddly . ''
`` how could you begin ? ''
'' said elizabeth .
when the massacre at lexington was '' news . ''
but it was not so .
mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat .
and good humour .
`` no it ai n't .
had suffered a relapse .
but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting .
and my situation in life .
and good society , '' he added , '' which was my chief inducement to enter the .
what a triumph for him .
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general .
the girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see .
the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance .
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane .
a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn .
a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature .
any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .
generous natures .
`` oh , go 'long with you , tom , before you aggravate me again .
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .
but they were all ashamed of their weakness , and none was brave enough to speak his thought .
provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
i did not hear above one word in ten .
that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood .
and his son will be just like him .
and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .
however .
wonderfully handsome .
and indeed i am quite of your opinion .
but unable to waste such a precious occasion .
who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! ''
`` and they must marry !
'two n't ever be known that we tried , anyway , long as we did n't succeed . ''
instead of viewing them as a stranger .
leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance .
`` believe me .
which made her two daughters ashamed .
injun joe 's bowie-knife lay close by , its blade broken in two .
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .
who had only heard of the welshman 's part of it before .
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth .
do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ''
`` afeard !
he would have tossed and fidgeted , as his nerves demanded , but he was afraid he might wake sid .
i war n't noticing . ''
injun joe 's !
there was novelty in the scheme .
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased .
that 's what it is .
how tired i am ! ''
`` nothing is more deceitful , '' said darcy , `` than the appearance of humility .
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety .
and lady lucas .
it 's an awful long way .
imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be .
`` i done it ! ''
i 'd protect you .
and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship .
tom withered him with derision !
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .
to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever .
`` i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known .
`` you are . ''
ben 's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump .
`` not at all , '' he replied .
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction .
they worked and sweated for half an hour .
and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide .
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline .
he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy .
the old man promised secrecy once more .
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
he found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls .
but when they had withdrawn .
in fact , everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction , now .
would n't you ?
where else can they be so well concealed ? ''
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
you are grievously to be pitied .
aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence .
but such as they were .
hear it ? ''
somehow , when there ai n't anybody to say i sha ' n't go in .
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
london : printed for t. egerton , military library , whitehall .
`` you are severe on us . ''
make haste , and come down this moment . ''
. ``
it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper .
becuz i do n't give a dern for a thing 'thout it 's tollable hard to git .
`` ye .
`` what should not you mind ? ''
and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .
with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received .
`` i do n't think i said anything , '' said sid .
'' replied elizabeth .
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man .
`` a thorough , determined dislike of me .
tom 's army won a great victory , after a long and hard-fought battle .
presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to `` cast off . ''
and she was quite decided at last .
at the next opportunity of speaking , `` whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ''
`` yes .
and that no such sums really existed in the world .
and summer finery and summer engagements arose .
and then replied , `` the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
`` but he paid her not the smallest attention .
which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .
`` there !
from the reason of things .
but , however , i hope it is not true .
which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
`` he is the best landlord , and the best master , '' said she , `` that ever lived .
i have nothing to say against him .
becky 's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes .
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .
for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious .
she had a sister married to a mr. philips .
professor somebody 's anatomy .
unable to resist the temptation .
she was delighting both him and herself .
about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed .
and took off my glove .
after breakfast , while huck had a smoke , and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition .
and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession !
an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion .
lady catherine it appeared .
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .
a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming .
but i am particularly attached to these young men .
and .
but , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions .
`` are you quite sure , ma'am ? .
an opening shaped like a letter a. its massive oaken door stood unbarred .
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement .
thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister .
nor did she much expect it would be asked .
those who chose to be idle , certainly might . ''
evidently spirits were abroad .
`` that 's just what i was thinking to myself , huck . ''
mr. wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat .
: of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted .
if , indeed , it should be so !
every day , to git a taste in my mouth , or i 'd a died , tom .
they got scorched out by and by , and drearily set about getting breakfast .
elizabeth most thankfully consented .
she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation .
for he was '' showing off , '' too .
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
but there was no getting around it .
and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .
from their point of view .
and who is there .
original `` compositions '' by the young ladies .
`` i reckon so , '' said huckleberry .
and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to .
assistance is impossible .
any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
the two men got out some food and made a luncheon .
the widow said she meant to give huck a home under her roof and have him educated .
with a renewal of tenderness .
no reply .
there was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear .
the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt .
who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , `` oh !
`` you shall .
stop crying and after that you could n't get them to leave .
and the first dark night we 'll go there and try 'em .
as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow 's stile .
`` because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago , and triple-locked .
and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away .
thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it .
but if it was the back fence i would n't mind and she would n't .
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room .
have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .
`` we 'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's woodshed .
said elizabeth , `` but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . ''
by this time she is actually with them !
and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .
i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i
the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright .
i shall hope to be in future secured .
but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
`` yes , she called yesterday with her father .
that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned .
to the vast surprise of the boys .
to be only just tolerable . ''
get into them .
here was matter for dismay , for they were soaked through and chilled .
`` no . ''
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward .
what did i make him do ? ''
`` we never had any governess . ''
did you carry anything there with you . ''
want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . ''
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite .
tom watched and watched .
you will have a charming mother-in-law .
`` my aunt .
`` i have just received your letter .
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . ''
' without there being a syllable said of her father .
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . ''
in a few minutes .
`` miss bennet .
horsewhipped ! .
for .
you got into no .
on this subject , what can you have to say ?
`` if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield .
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content .
what 'd you see , tom ? ''
cried miss bingley , `` charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .
was beneath me.. it is done .
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint .
she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn .
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ''
before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that
the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner , dead to the world and its happenings .
now tom began to scrawl something on the slate , hiding the words from the girl .
little did i know then , how soon .
i will tell if you 'll promise you wo n't ever say it was me . ''
perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .
and the noise of vehicles ceased .
`` yes ! ...
their opinion of every body .
as a brother .
nor honour .
his pliant toes closed upon it , and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner .
`` yes .
and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one .
in the name of all my family .
her family under less than half the present distance . ''
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .
after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant .
the poor fellow 's face was haggard , and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him .
soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees .
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? .
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared .
their situation was awkward enough .
but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
they wished in their hearts they had waited a year .
`` that is to say , you had given your permission .
you 're a watchman , ai n't you !
instead of the aunt .
said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room .
you 've let that slip without intending it .
`` she times them ill. '' `` i do not cough for my own amusement , '' replied kitty fretfully .
`` i remember hearing you once say .
the carriage was sent to meet them at .
or me either , for that matter .
left there by tourists .
for a few minutes he was silent .
`` tom , you .
just as earnest as ever i was in my life .
tom hesitated and looked confused .
sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .
as she affectionately embraced her .
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
to elizabeth it appeared .
please , becky .
if his own vanity .
be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ''
however , this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory .
but to be candid without ostentation or design .
there was an easy .
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another .
`` your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .
`` cert'nly .
huck began to dig and scratch now .
dreampt about rats . ''
`` i could smoke it all day .
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
and is it really true ?
now do n't you see how i 'm fixed ?
tom entered , struggling with the weight of his sacks , and aunt polly did not finish her sentence .
looky-here , tom , being rich ai n't what it 's cracked up to be .
'' replied wickham , `` i can hardly be just to him . ''
trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
`` i had much rather go in the coach . ''
as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
hey , hucky ! ''
when mr. collins joining in .
he had denied it for form 's sake and because it was custom .
`` and do you really know all this ? ''
it was of a pattern which does not vary , and so it is familiar to us all .
and if i have to kill you , i 'll kill her .
but all trials bring their compensations .
and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort .
`` like ?
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''
in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune .
upon the threshold of the camp .
during dinner , mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all .
`` well , if i do n't want you in the daytime , i 'll let you sleep .
with a great show of cheerfulness : `` i bet there 's been pirates on this island before , boys .
`` why .
darcy ! ''
quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye .
come ! ''
`` oh !
`` i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution .
`` how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ''
instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a stolen melon .
nothing .
as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ''
`` oh , it 's ever so gay !
he had never had the slightest suspicion .
`` who 's accused you ? ''
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of .
`` i lay i did !
they stood for some time without speaking a word .
and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws .
'' said mrs. bennet to her husband .
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at .
`` you need not distress yourself .
tom found a subterranean lake .
because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution .
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .
`` what 's that you got ? ''
all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
but .
that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage .
now make me coming along . ''
she knew that tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets .
tom pretended not to see her .
and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called `` mrs. wickham , '' by each of them .
said tom .
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?
very nonsensical to come at all !
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . ''
poor lydia 's situation must , at best , be bad enough .
go 'long sid , mary , tom .
`` do , tom ! ''
aunt polly took it , held it up .
as for elizabeth herself .
he would be killed for knowing it , sure .
the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself .
`` you bad ! ''
`` yes , they talk like that , all the time .
which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .
the hours wasted away , and hunger came to torment the captives again .
moreover .
but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .
i see the imprudence of it.. oh !
and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping .
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september .
and the beetle fell a couple of yards away , and lit on its back once more .
some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .
and ride off as fast as i could . ''
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . ''
every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book .
well ?
so to speak , and went to work to `` get his verses . ''
he continued after a pause .
and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed .
another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed
and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work .
after which the armies fell into line and marched away , and tom turned homeward alone .
there was no joy in them any more .
and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle .
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain
when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country .
sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries .
elizabeth .
and you only the second.. the younger ones out before the elder are married ! .
as soon as he should be of age .
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her .
who could not be enough detested .
the black avenger stood still with folded arms .
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
his character was to speak for itself .
but they 've got to do it .
little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do , and sudden retchings followed every time .
sid had learned his lesson days before .
to considerably more than a thousand pounds .
it is too beautiful , too beautiful for this mortal earth . ''
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park .
provided she can have her own way.. but i tell you what .
you are very , very sick ! ''
`` might !
`` i was hid . ''
this indifference must be broken up at any cost .
tom .
`` yes . ''
and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment .
she tole me i got to go an ' git dis
`` you made him .
she was an inveterate experimenter in these things .
elizabeth was again deep in thought .
hot again .
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew .
let her go then .
and he told her of feelings .
`` that my father should have left so small a collection
`` this walk is not wide enough for our party .
`` point it is , sir ! ''
and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .
and had mr. wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation .
so often to miss watson 's as they did when they first came .
and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
besides , there was truth in his looks . ''
would be adorned by her.. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship .
and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy .
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner .
`` i never heard that it was . ''
they had a mind not to say them at all .
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets .
lydia 's being settled in the north .
tom 's cheeks burned .
i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself .
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford . ''
and aunt polly , also .
bingley was punctual to his appointment .
in the end .
becky cried .
while she chose to entertain herself in this manner .
as long as she stays there , it is all very well .
but still loud enough for the furniture to hear : `` well .
huck , i 'll take you right to it in a skiff .
`` well , but we ca n't be wrong .
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased .
was a ruin .
and they wonder he was n't ever hung before . ''
but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon .
and should never resent her behaviour as any affront .
often i says to myself .
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .
now , what 'er you belting me for ? .
`` yes .
come no more to bother me ! '
comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment .
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .
in spite of this amendment .
there 's few enough would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long night comes .
seemed .
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified .
and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
mr. darcy bowed .
again and again , to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there .
and i can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .
his head drooped lower and lower , both men began to snore now .
elizabeth saw what he was doing .
and she had nothing to hope .
said : `` you 've been mighty good to me .
and had about worn himself out with getting it there .
least i reckon so . ''
certainly .
his pity was moved .
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .
and they wondered what kind of material he was made of .
one was a-smoking , and t'other one wanted a light .
because if you speak the charm 's busted . ''
it stands to reason .
and aunt polly 's family , were being put into mourning , with great grief and many tears .
and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic .
i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it . ''
i been creeping all over , ever since i got here . ''
i 'll not cry , if she does .
the boys dressed themselves .
after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar .
but found to his surprise that he did not want to .
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn .
when the boys reached the welshman's house , they stopped to rest .
senses and he saw that he had made a blunder .
and she knew she was winning her fight .
as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .
`` yes .
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .
he began to doze , in spite of himself .
mrs. philips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance .
with false excuses for their sudden departure .
when if they had gone to scotland .
hopes .
they dried their boiled ham and had a feast .
and so the latter 's prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary .
nothing offered for some little time .
and we 'll have a piping hot one , too .
her face , all glowing with the struggle , came up and submitted .
there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
not to appear to disgrace his family .
about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree .
should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough .
the apothecary came .
he had regarded his passion as adoration .
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of .
that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with .
cure warts with . ''
the loo table , however , did not appear .
and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it .
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .
`` miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .
i do n't want to sell him . ''
and through them be transmitted to the whole town , for he refused to part with his secret .
`` that ai n't anything .
and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation .
and your displeasure at this representation of them .
and then you burn up the rest of the bean .
purring , eyeing the teaspoon avariciously , and begging for a taste .
he said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there .
they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would
burn it up .
`` well , it 's blamed mean .
a fine , portly , middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair .
and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity .
mr. jones said : `` tom was n't at home , yet , so i gave him up .
and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth .
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied .
elizabeth said no more .
but my dearest love .
these were strange words to the vagabond boy 's ears , and the pleasantest he had ever heard .
but i can guess how it was .
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition .
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .
i want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright .
and time was fleeting .
have been alluding .
might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
huck 's heart shot into his throat , but he swallowed it again .
'' replied the other , `` for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night .
or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .
the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people ! .
that 's a good boy . ''
denoted a recollection of jane .
and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort
a certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind .
first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim .
climb the thin column of smoke , linger at its top a moment , and then .
whatever of good or bad was to be told .
you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family .
for he was not listening .
and be ready to believe .
though this might be imaginary .
start him up . ''
your father of course may spare you .
'' tom said : `` now you see this bluff here
and passed it around her so that she could see it .
we do not suffer by accident .
she took them to a bedchamber and said : `` now wash and dress yourselves .
it is. ``
better still .
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips .
`` gracechurch-street , monday , august 2 .
`` it is a rule with me .
it was simply fire in a liquid form .
i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ''
at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered , and that he immediately sneaked away .
has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure .
and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .
when bingley .
and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation .
the boys ' breath forsook them .
and .
`` indeed i had .
and a hermit 's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find .
and i should be miserable to forfeit it .
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty .
and whose character she had no reason to question .
said he .
that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
while they were dressing .
and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation .
how is such a man to be worked on ?
i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse . ''
but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
and then we were so merry all the way home !
this uncertainty must be swept away .
miss bennet paused a little and then replied .
in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
`` not at all . ''
`` there , d'you hear that !
and that ai n't all .
but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .
he never meant any harm , and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was '' .
`` steady , steady-y-y-y ! ''
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter .
`` well , why do n't you ?
and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .
tom tried again , with soothing words in his mouth , and was repulsed again .
`` i am sure i shall break mine , '' said lydia .
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .
so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing . ''
tom pricked up his ears .
the master searched face after face for signs of guilt .
that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection .
there was once a church choir that was not ill-bred , but i have forgotten where it was , now .
he had tried to do right and get along , but they would not let him .
and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth .
`` about a month , '' said elizabeth .
`` he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , '' said her uncle .
and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out .
gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs .
tom managed to sign his initials , using the ball of his little finger for a pen .
you hear that ? ''
`` look here !
could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley .
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common .
his anguish grew with his progress .
earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
do n't you remember , huck ?
`` your father 's estate is entailed on mr. collins , i think .
when is it going to be ? ''
ouch !
and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .
she is grown so brown and coarse !
with tears and lamentations of regret .
sid seemed satisfied .
or a voluntary penance .
such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly .
at last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered : `` let me see it . ''
it ai n't any use any more . ''
hard a port !
i knew he would manage every thing .
was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood .
`` do you know .
finally he said : `` well .
and the concern of every body was well talked over.. to elizabeth .
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before .
one of you .
any time you see something 's up , in the night , just skip right around and maow . ''
the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .
`` i never did see the beat of that boy ! ''
unfortunately an only son .
however .
certainly.. i am sure lizzy will be very happy .
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . ''
`` we can all plague and punish one another .
of which mr. collins pointed out .
when he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown .
loaded it with tobacco , and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke .
a single man of large fortune .
majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted .
to the enquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid .
he had meant the best in the world , and been treated like a dog .
they hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine .
but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry .
`` well , what 's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime ! .
jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
planted his foot carefully and firmly .
`` maybe not , maybe not .
his own father did not long survive mine .
'' replied sir william .
but as i have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ''
unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
at the same time .
and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard .
i reckon we have n't got the right place . ''
and the two eldest .
the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation .
then bent over and whispered in his ear : `` 'tai n't a spaniard .
huck started sorrowfully away .
gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party .
`` the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .
`` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly .
who attended to you ?
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's
that is to say , he `` found a clew . ''
over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar .
dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend , william collins . ''
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .
offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle .
unwilling to let the subject drop .
not on herself , for she was never ailing , but on anybody else that came handy .
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .
to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house .
he could swear wonderfully .
people do not die of little trifling colds .
however .
his eyes flaming with passion .
the boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village .
how grievous then was the thought that .
though her spirits are greatly shaken .
and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy .
who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection .
replied wickham , .
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen .
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy 's delight , when she should enter the room .
baby !
deep , unalloyed pleasure is concerned , the advantage was with the boy , not the astronomer .
how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in tom 's arms .
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture .
i can not pretend to say.. you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . ''
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year .
`` and joe ? ''
one day 's delay she observed , would be of small importance .
when turning hastily round , she added , `` i take no leave of you , miss bennet .
the majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations .
for the master boarded in his father 's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him .
tom was whitewashing with vigor .
i shall now know how to act .
but our visitor was very obstinate .
he wished he dared venture to warn her .
to apply to her father .
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich .
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .
after dinner .
far from the haunts of men , and they said they never would return to civilization .
mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .
and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .
there now ! ''
as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn .
for body-snatching .
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged .
or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .
`` a young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable '' .
the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment .
his aunt detected the act and made him let it go .
and saying , `` i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley !
and to be kept back on such a motive ! .
she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and
again his astonishment was obvious .
now you wo n't , will you ? ''
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy .
for we are proud of little boys that learn .
it is natural that obligation should be felt .
as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other .
she found that the medicine did really diminish .
time with `` it is your turn to say something now .
by and by attention ceased from him , and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more .
and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
if i have been very presuming .
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified .
tom thought a long time .
she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.. if you have not been mistaken here .
'' said she .
while mrs. reynolds replied .
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
becky said : `` why .
will you allow me .
out with your spring-line .
`` i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .
as you well know .
forever and forever .
and stealing sugar as opportunity offered .
and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .
`` nay .
describe them .
mr. bennet replied that he had not .
rot him ! ''
[ the boys were sick with terror in a moment . ]
then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and an f , and the oath was complete .
if he were so , they could not succeed .
and the kindness of the late mr. darcy .
every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .
no .

they began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away .
then his pride was up , and he strode away and went outside .

presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished .
`` i 'll never speak to you again as long as i live , '' said joe , rising .
said elizabeth .
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .
she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .
shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village .
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .

`` at noon .
they were by the bed , and the bed was between them and the door .
there 't is again ! ''
`` now .
`` and i believe you would if you had thought of it . ''
and he scarcely opened his lips .
he had never before supposed that .
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .
and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .
tom got his lantern .
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company .

he waylaid other boys as they came .
that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere .
he never plays them alike , two days , and how is a body to know what 's coming ?
wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .
`` now i am quite happy , '' said she , `` for you will be as happy as myself .
other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification .
and that was strange .
yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters .

and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .

a natural fillip followed .
it 's all a mixed-up crookedness to me . ''
the girl chirped on .
soon after they were seated at table , `` this is a most unfortunate affair .
and so i just brought them along in a hurry . ''
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !
by-and-by tom said : `` sh !
i shall go distracted . ''
and she spoke very little .
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church .
and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time .
and he knew it .
why , it seems 'bout a year ago .
she only smiles , i laugh .
to give the haunted house a wide berth .
'' observed elizabeth , `` you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . ''
when mr. darcy gave her the letter .

the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps .
then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file , and so brought him to .
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops , and killed and scalped each other by thousands .
in a very close hand.. the envelope itself was likewise full.. pursuing her way along the lane .
in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted .
and down , and still down , into the earth , and it was just the same .
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london .
he talked hopefully to becky .
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .
`` melancholy '' .

`` very much . ''
every eye fixed itself upon him .
with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.. to convince him .
elizabeth could bear it no longer .
`` you stay here , huck , till i come . ''
and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated
and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation .
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .
`` you 'll tell . ''
and hurried her away to her room .
and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . ''
he added .
and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .
he had always intended to visit him .
after discharging his conscience on that head .
`` dad fetch it !
`` oh , tom , you did n't make any marks ! ''
for when supper was over .
it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton .

there was a ripple of mirth , which the court checked .

proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .

mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
`` less see 'em . ''
`` huck , that money was n't ever in no .
he sprung his secret about huck 's share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of .

i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .

when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .
so the treasure was gone forever .
to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . ''
and thus began , `` in vain have i struggled .
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .

mrs. bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married .
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit .
might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .

injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out .
`` tom .
his brow contracted , his air gloomy .
s'pose something happened and injun joe did n't hang ?
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me .
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ''
with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension .
`` where 'll we dig ? ''
well , jane , make haste and tell us .
presently tom seized his comrade 's arm and said : `` sh ! ''
the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher 's head .
i have more than once observed to lady catherine .
it had its effect .
and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure .
we 'd drop down dead .
or on the evenness of his lines .
and now .

huck found a spring of clear cold water close by .
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over .
`` there can be no doubt of that .
she was going to the butcher 's .
the mighty river lay like an ocean at rest .

`` now , that 's something like !
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
i take up my pen again to do .
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia .
`` oh yes ! .
what a hero tom was become , now !
`` so much the better .
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her
`` what orgies ? ''
`` and then you began to cry . ''
proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity .

that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place .
she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcy 's sister .
though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling .

he proposed to explore .

but so it was .

and if he becomes really attached to me .
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay .

but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .

they instantly passed through the hall once more .
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .

returned for half a minute with an additional glow .
to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray .
`` not so hasty , if you please .
small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !
he untied the skiff at the stern , slipped into it , and was soon rowing cautiously upstream .
and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's .
just one little snifter would fetch him . ''
quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window , tore his way through all opposers , and was gone !
as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .

was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?
all gazed , nobody spoke for a moment .
she related the subject of the pictures .
`` they were brightened by the exercise . `` .
she had never .
and a sister's partiality is not misleading me .
i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality .
you tell me .
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .

yet , how just a humiliation ! .
`` well , i do n't know .

at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them .
presently the watcher began to nod .
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . ''
who was left by herself .
miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
what hours of transport we shall spend !
and had thread bound about them .
they were hopeless of remedy .
and at the age of twenty-seven .

and the other course .
she was even sensible of some pleasure .
this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms , and he began to encourage them with considerable hope .
and with a more smiling solemnity replied .

with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it .
the cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy .
this composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening .
`` have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? ''
though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
here 's a big milum apple i 've been saving for you .

the first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger .
`` lord , how is this , joe ? ''
and where they were now to spend a few days .
`` tom , what on earth ails that cat ? ''
and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
well .
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself .
she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
with labor and difficulty , and plastered his hair close down to his head .

he sat down by her and put his arms around her .

yes , they had forced him to it at last : he would lead a life of crime .
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .

mrs. bennet was doubly engaged .
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure .
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure .

jumping at it from every point of a circle .
her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well .
he reeled and fell partly upon potter .
and she glanced ever so furtively at tom .

tom struggled awhile and then retired , utterly defeated .

but no two theories were alike , and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case .

not a syllable was uttered by either .

the child 's delight was boundless .
i hate them ornery sermons !
his actions were capable of a very different construction .
when you want to get revenge on a woman you don't kill her .
she believed he might have the best informed mind .
flying to her .
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .
and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright .
course you would ! ''
i can not but wonder .
to be secure of judging properly at first . ''
considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
`` now , huck , the storm 's over , and i 'll go home .
how he lived i know not .
`` but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . ''
`` with my mother up stairs .
`` i should not be surprised .
would they notice we had n't come ? ''
with regard to lydia at least .
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
according to their situation in life .
and there ai n't anybody dead there yet . ''
stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .
or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .
he followed its winding course , first to the right , then to the left , huck at his heels .
joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner .
and elizabeth continued her walk alone .
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .
and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him .
it was gratitude.. gratitude .
and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter . ''
`` yes , they do .
of course the schoolmaster gave holi-day for that afternoon .
moreover .
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .
in most countries they 're awful high up in the nobility .
to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , .
in their first evening at mr. philips 's .
and however bare of news the country in general might be .
it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley .
without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .
`` oh , tom , i reckon we 're goners .
well , i would n't stand that , tom .
and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear .
`` huck and tom sawyer . ''
and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .
and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude .
he was the person .
but his tongue was tied , his breath would hardly come , his heart quaked .
from twenty voices .
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more .
`` that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .
deed and deed and double deed wo n't . ''
with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but tom and amy .
they found the sharp new heap they were seeking .
and so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction .
`` what , a'ready ?
so i did .
in so close a confederacy .
and tom 's mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that .
`` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within
with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .
and very like him .
the usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed .
the oath was administered .
she 'lowed she 'd 'tend to de whitewashin ' . ''
that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness .
and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window
so appealingly .
i thought it would never be over .
but of all the views which his garden .

i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . ''
as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ''
its effect was most extraordinary .
`` was to shew you .
or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . ''
'' said bingley .
and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate .
it would be dreadful !
at length the chaise arrived .
`` let him alone , i tell you . ''
it seems an hopeless business . ''
and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ''
he has given in all his debts .
trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels .
though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .
and how to go to bed .
that speech savours strongly of disappointment . ''
for it was no use for her to try any more .
we can find it . ''
but without any symptom of peculiar regard .
you have liked many a stupider person . ''
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it .
tom 's days were days of splendor and exultation to him , but his nights were seasons of horror .
to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer .
they said no , they were not feeling very well .
how much of good or evil must be done by him !
he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
`` with great energy.. but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ''
then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life .
`` shake out that maintogalans ' l !
they could talk of nothing but officers .
discontented or too poor .

elizabeth was not comfortable .
but if i 'd been better sometimes. ``
`` very true .
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ''
had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was `` ha'nted '' .

she plays and sings all day long .

i would n't ever got into all this trouble if it had n't ' a ' ben for that money .
i would try to believe almost any thing .
the window went up .
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .
made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
and shook him .
`` and we mean to treat you all , '' added lydia .
getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might be .
any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . ''
`` i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on .
a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .

`` yet why did he come ? ''
huck said : `` i ca n't .
we can all begin freely .
`` very well.. that reply will do for the present.. perhaps by and bye i may observe
then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names .
and they were going to the camp.. and from her correspondence with her sister .
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .

`` there is something a little stately in him to be sure .
that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children .
`` why , robbers , of course .

he replied , and was again silent .
he spied the beetle .
and i trust i am resigned .
you make them raise all they can , off ' n their friends .
'' said miss lucas , `` but i wish he had danced with eliza . ''
he had me horsewhipped ! .
and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother .
honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening .
she was satisfied with the monster , and whispered : `` it 's a beautiful man .
presently tom checked his whistle .
`` i do n't care for fishing .
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia .
`` i do .
part of the house hear : `` in the graveyard ! ''
that remaining partiality for her .
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .
too , and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered .
and then said with a shaky voice : `` tom , less git out of here ! ''
the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that
he found huck still in the bed that had been provided for him , and delirious with fever .
he really loved me .
tom said he thought he would n't mind it .
too .
all our connections are so different .
i backed up agin the wall to have another think .
this was his plan of amends .
`` sho , there 's ticks a plenty .
though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong .
or in reading and writing .
the next day the doctors were back .
`` and i am inclined to think that you would not
i will if it 's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost . ''
the wise-heads had `` put this and that together '' and decided that the lads
`` john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us.. was it so ? ''
i would kill him if he was here .
`` i. ``
it would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while .
and gave his orders in a low .
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise .
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
he tried to get becky to talk , but her sorrows were too oppressive , all her hopes were gone .
would always coincide .
it will be dark in fifteen minutes .
and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt 's arrival .
the solemn hush continued .
that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .
huck .
and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
but no more .
tom mentally ran over the days of the week .
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire .
that 's what you was doing !
plainly here were `` two souls with but a single thought . ''
he was very ill , he was interested in nothing .
that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
a present from my master .
i guessed as much . ''
sounds so , anyway .
but enough of this .
you take delight in vexing me .
she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out
`` how you talk !
`` now that you treat me so , i will see . ''
the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs. collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .
`` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship .
but you know you never did .
the conversation soon turned upon fishing .
and when he had finished and still stood alive and whole .
and her husband 's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .
he knows where we live .
`` oh !
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn .
after an affectionate parting between the friends .
her husband looked impenetrably grave .
it would cover up a power of sins , tom .
but he only distorted them more than ever , and the tittering was more pronounced .

it is slight .
instantly seized the other .

`` you are very cruel .
`` certainly .
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .
he had a citified air about him that ate into tom 's vitals .
it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
she could think only of her letter .
and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once .

they 're coming right toward the door . ''
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
he was on one side of her mother .
`` no , not rot him .
then she was just a grain troubled .
and of what he had told her , all the way home .
one seems so forlorn without them . ''
as they were leaving the room huck sprang up and exclaimed : `` oh .
and the delay of his plan .
bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed .
well , this comes nearest to being under the cross .
it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so
a paper that 's got to be ciphered over about a week because it 's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics . ''
and these strong objections probably were .
`` yes .
`` i admire the activity of your benevolence .
a sort of glorying over tom which was wellnigh unbearable .
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .
her colour changed , and she said no more .
they had started down the hill by this time .
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .
bingley looked at her so expressively .
two or three pairs of old moccasins .
he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house 's silence .
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .
while they waited at table .
it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .
aimlessly .
without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .
i never heard of it before . ''
gravity and absentmindedness followed , and then melancholy .
after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty ! .
`` if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me .
long white hair flowed from under his sombrero , and he wore green goggles .
that he talked less than on former occasions .
she felt as if hearing it all .
. ``
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage .
dear me !
and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself .
quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book .
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude .
`` these are heavy misfortunes , '' replied elizabeth .
without hearing miss bingley 's voice .
huckleberry viewed it wistfully .
if he even did that much .
soon after you left me on saturday .
sid would have thought .
and she would have been content to find twenty per cent .
`` care of him ! .
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .
desirous of knowing how she .
you must remember .
or a new parasol .
the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing .
`` exceed their income !
then he said : `` well , you see , i 'm a kind of a hard lot , .
without the intention of marriage .
and if he do n't go to that no .
tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted .
becky 's face paled , but she thought she could .
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .
said she .
who 's robin hood ? ''
the other pirates envied him this majestic vice , and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly .
they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
for having received ordination at easter .
'' when some unlucky recollections obtruded .
`` and really .
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it .
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ''
and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe .
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration .
for mrs. bennet .
in token of the coachman's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .
sereny harper shall know of this before i 'm an hour older .
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other .

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london .
the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter .
it was getting so lonesome anyway , and now it 'll be worse .
while rolling ten-pins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement .
was there really any use ?
they were in .
it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it .

the dejection was almost universal .
`` i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself .
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .
and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he
mr. darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , .
after some time .

from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane .
my temper would perhaps be called resentful.. my good opinion once lost is lost for ever . ''
for to her inexpressible vexation .
but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
it should not be said .
`` upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood .
and the next instant he was sprawling on the floor !
and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech .
sighing , he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank .
`` that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost
splendid , ungraspable dollars .
`` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow .
and perhaps he might be doing the same .
`` hours .
let 's us go , too , tom . ''
`` though it is difficult .
`` and i dreamt that joe harper 's mother was here . ''

`` is going to-morrow into that part of the town .

by and by they separated into three hostile tribes .

as that was the case .
what could it mean ?
`` half-rotten plank .
as if his longing eyes had been fixed .
and what 's more , he can throw him over that fence , too . ''
i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
miss bingley 's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy 's progress through his book .
and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time .
it was on a hill , about a mile and a half from the village .
the work went on .
he wanted to explore its borders .
and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach .
they 're so lovely , all spotted up . ''
as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .
embracing its head with its arms .
of what evils you may incur .
reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .
but they seemed hungrier than before .
i was told .

that it was impossible for darcy to leave her .

`` you did !

`` heart longings , '' etc. , etc .

`` i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable . ''

an unusual quiet possessed the village , although it was ordinarily quiet enough , in all conscience .

i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ''
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him .
with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls .
`` yes , but she ai n't dead .
very little was said by either .
i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening .
the harpers , the rogerses .

`` you have .
about her pleasure in being at hunsford .
of having injured mr. wickham .
i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation .
but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance .
at last he got up cautiously .
let me hear what it is . ''
and calmly replied , `` why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? .
for although he carried .
you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .
from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers .
they ai n't only two taverns .
there .
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man .
he scratched his head with a perplexed air , and said : `` well , that beats anything ! ''
i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .
`` but depend upon it .
`` we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , '' said elizabeth .
he banged at the door .
and called tom a bad , vicious , vulgar child , and ordered him away .
first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .
your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .
to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust .
who continued , though slowly , to mend .
`` holler 'nuff ! ''
let 's run ! ''
mr. wickham 's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom .
`` and it seems to me that you said , 'why , i believe that that door . ' ''
that he had no pleasing intelligence to send .
there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style .
not now . ''
i got more . ''
devils do n't slosh around much of a sunday , i don't reckon . ''
and when it's midnight a devil will come .
but you know mighty well people do n't go about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night . ''
`` it 's our wedding-cake , tom . ''
allow me .
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . ''
her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy 's explanation there .
when he got to where they were .
and huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out .
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .
and so forth and so on .
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her .
he put the bark hastily in his pocket .
nothing was said for some time .
then he laid him down on the ground under it .
tom urged .

he heard her attentively .
at school the children made so much of him and of joe .
`` what is it ! ''
and then let them follow us if they want to .
if he is satisfied with only regretting me .
but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ''
and there was my aunt .
presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red-handed .
to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go .
he began to find himself hanging around her father's house , nights , and feeling very miserable .
`` she had better have stayed at home , '' cried elizabeth .
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs. bennet's heart .
not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter .
might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
with trembling energy.. though lydia had never been a favourite with them .

endeavouring to compose herself .

if you could come over on a log to go to your funeral .
`` i may enter his county with impunity .
i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account .
is this to be endured !
as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous .
his coming into the country at all .
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife .
`` i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughter-house . ''
`` sometimes .
and in the course of it the old man said that
to be upon the spot .
i just expected she would be tired to death . ''
something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. never intended to go there .
but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ''
two men entered .
`` it has been a very agreeable day , '' said miss bennet to elizabeth .
therefore you need not conceal your age . ''
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there .

perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying .
deliberated on the probability of each statement .
and the boys .

that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's .
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction .
but i must write no more .
it seemed to him that the noon recess would never come .
come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job .

or the place where she lived , or any thing .

'' said she .
he turned to her again .
he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work .
not untinctured by tenderness .
i ai n't everybody , and i can't stand it .
mr. darcy 's behaviour astonished and vexed her .
and see if i can make it up any better . ''
nobody wants him to come .
when opportunity should offer , in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master .
this way .
as if he had been the drummer at the head of

he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton .
`` oh , i did n't know what i was a-doing .
though still existing .
awkward and solemn .
when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i can not tell .
`` what could he mean ?
'' he thought better of it and held his peace , for there was danger in tom 's eye .
and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows .
and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .
it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
partly because of the awful greatness of the man , but mainly because he was her parent .
what 's the matter with your tooth ? ''
or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back .
he had an inspiration !
this final feather broke the camel 's back .
`` perhaps we might be deceived . ''
and at this ball , what do you think he did ?
she said she would do her best by him .
'' said they , `` you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in '' .
cried elizabeth , `` i am excessively diverted .
'' whispered her aunt .
and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines .
mrs. gardiner .
send them in , for i am quite at leisure . ''
it only `` set him up '' the more and made him
honest , now , old feller .
least everybody says so , and i do n't see nothing agin it .
but tom would not venture .
during his mayoralty .
the weary time dragged on .
and met maria in the landing place .
and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins .
and he continued : `` my reasons for marrying are .
i had not an idea of it . ''
he tried to steal sugar under his aunt 's very nose , and got his knuckles rapped for it .
they arrived hot and panting .
if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .
and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house .
are you strong enough ? ''
did you see it ? ''
but i stumbled on him and huck right at my door .
obliged to submit .
and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream .
which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
there was no choice .
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .
i 'll smoke private and cuss private , and crowd through or bust .
but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip .
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach .
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl .
had i but explained some part of it only .
mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .
`` perhaps she meant well .
on the big rock over yonder .
and mr. gardiner .
and he soon afterwards said aloud .
`` hellum-a-lee .
a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly ! .
whacks 'em over the head with her thimble .
and last of all came the model boy .
i 've come now becuz i wanted to know about it , you know .
they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort .
`` mr .
how could i be so silly as to wish it !
the boys examined three of them with no result .
he addressed himself particularly to her .
mr. wickham began the subject himself .
he asked for it so often that he became a nuisance .
`` made a mouth '' at him and gave him the
and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path .
for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him .
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
some said that now and then .
while it lasted , he got them interested in a new device .
injun joe sprang to his feet .
`` you are . ''
`` no , i believe not . ''
miss bingley 's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .
dern 'd if i hai n't got to ask to do everything .
he could not move .
`` well , if it 's got to be done , let 's get at it .
shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow .
though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe .
told the girls what an honour they might expect .
`` but she was very glad to see me .
and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book .
and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised .
that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner . ''
for mary .
who would certainly miss her .
`` i dislike it very much , '' he replied .
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew .
saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
it was the meanest kind of luck !
`` laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .
by this time the dental instruments were ready .
`` i know now ! ''
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness .
and now , i hope you are satisfied . ''
now , but they did not notice it .
elizabeth opened the letter .
and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay .
she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham .
tom , you can bet there 's a ghost mighty close behind it .
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman .
in her partiality for wickham .
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .
but something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it .
that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his .
and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so.. nay .
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
reason with .
`` she !
but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason .
i can hardly write for laughing .
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent .
she then sat still five minutes longer .
the tick tried this .
that if he is so .
just the same . ''
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent .
we spotted the shadder to a dot . ''
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? ''
of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .
miss bingley .
and described how he and becky had watched the flame struggle and expire .
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .
the boys all hated him , he was so good .
i assure you .
were particularly welcome .
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate .
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person .
`` i do not believe a word of it , my dear .
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him .
tom presented himself before aunt polly .
all in deep black .
a splendid elegant bible .
tom sawyer find it !
and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !
`` it ai n't a gal at all .
and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight .
and so accomplished ! .
she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .
his claims on mr. darcy .
in such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent .
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas .
have n't you , huck ?
restless , noisy , and troublesome .
tom went about .
it might be three feet deep , it might be a hundred .
are you in real dead-wood earnest , tom ? ''
as a very desirable partner.. you can not refuse to dance .
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .
when i 'm gone. ``
they must find a spring .
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister .
why , of course it is .
`` ten thousand pounds !
determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .
when it was no longer likely they should meet .
how are you all ? ''
huck , but you ought to have the credit of what you did . ''
coaxed and threatened her by turns .
i made a point of her having two men servants go with her.. miss darcy .
`` look here , joe harper , whose is that tick ? ''
he had all the best part of beauty .
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !
they swore in the signpainter 's boy , told him the scheme , and asked his help .
on which he was represented .
he did every thing best in the world .
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors .
so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
the wisest and the best of men .
but i have other provocations .
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud . ''
`` because the bush is in your way .
we seem to have been designed for each other . ''
`` and have you answered the letter ? ''
i do , honest . ''
it 's more surer . ''
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh .
he was in a tremendous state of excitement .
now passed by him either at work in the garden .
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune .
swear to keep mum . ''
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .
or any congratulations to elizabeth .
silence , for a minute .
two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave .
do n't you wish you could ?
`` he .
`` no .
mr. darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict .
`` you certainly do , '' she replied with a smile .
`` nothing !
anyway , what 's her name , tom ? ''
the gentlemen did approach .
and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
tom 's whole being applauded this idea .
`` why , what 's the matter , tom ?
broken at intervals by muffled sobs , and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed .
lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy .
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .
were questions with which she amused herself .
and after a time exclaimed .
and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ''
miss bingley did the same .
and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance .
carried no information to her mind .
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation .
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .
you do not know what he really is .
and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view .
or rather he has not wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
poor jane !
`` you must be surprised , very much surprised , .
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .
for the sake of her family .
little more than half a day's journey .
and the signpainter 's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on
for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled .
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . ''
and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
i 'll foller him .
were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane .
she began at length to recover .
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. philips 's manners and politeness .
'' said he .
and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue .
of mr. wickham .
they shortly came to one and had to stop .
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .
huck could not bear the look , and dropped his eyes .
imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy .
elizabeth was forced to go .
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
her 's lasted a little longer .
we must not make him desperate . ''
he would have liked to fall down and worship him , if it were in the dark .
he found that in the best tavern , no .
`` i !
when they repaired to the dining-room .
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just .
for a woman who had already refused him .
bear a hand and we'll see what it 's here for .
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .
no one but mrs. bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short .
to think of the box of money another time that day .
`` you followed him ? ''
if he came only to be silent .
she could not understand it .
'' said his lady to him one day .
she dropped the sentence where it was .
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual .
let us return to the `` examination . ''
silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush .
and she continued .
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence .
compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence , and sat down on a tree-box discouraged .
and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life .
and i tell you he 'd clean it out pretty quick .
let me advise you then .
and very lively hopes of mr. bingley 's heart were entertained .
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham 's removal from the .
i suppose , are precisely what you are without . ''
for it rained hard .
he whispered .
all right .
it amazes me , i confess.. for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .
they had n't any tools left to work with .
a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building .
oh !
though your accusations were ill-founded .
the two heads bowed together over the slate , and the two souls dead to all things else .
at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe .
but she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise .
but if only the worthy ones got his blessings and had his hand to help them over the rough places .
and was not yet returned .
`` oh , bother !
on their first arrival at lambton .
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . ''
tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes .
`` i do n't know , aunt . ''
`` you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you
only while he could button the flower inside his jacket , next his heart .
how i laughed !
with that patch-eyed spanish devil going for me all through 'em .
the day passed most pleasantly away .
just as we were all gone to bed .
and in almost every line of each .
there ai n't many left .
see ? ''
the handle of a knife , four pieces of orange-peel , and a dilapidated old window sash .
the two men examined the handful of coins .
of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering
and still different from either , was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last .
he remembered that there was company at the pump .
and forty .
do n't think me angry .
that your estate should be entailed away from your own children .
their manners are not equal to his . ''
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head .
by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .
had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .
it had not been very great .
with assumed tranquillity he then replied .
huck , where we 're a-standing you could touch that hole i got out of with a fishing-pole .
the quicker the better .
came again .
`` you are joking , lizzy .
all the tedious night the town waited for news .
and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings .
jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .
at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three-fourths of the work .
